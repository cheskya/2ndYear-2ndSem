## Awakening from the Sleep of Inhumanity

- awakening to the reality of an oppressed and subjugated world
- a world whose liberation is the basic task of every human being, so that in this way human beings may finally come to be human

### Author's Story

- further studies in philosophy and theology induced a rude awakening from "dogmatic slumber"
	- exegetical criticism
	- *Bultmann's* demythologizing
	- modernism and relativism of the church

- we continued to sleep in the much deeper sleep of inhumanity-- the sleep of egocentrism and selfishness
	- life and studies had not given him new eyes to see the world as it really is

- truth, love, etc.-- these were somehow to be found among the poor and in the cause of justice
	- are we really human and, if we are believers, is our faith human?
	- let ourselves be moved to compassion and mercy

- first world and third world
	- first world is only interested in ways to despoil the third world in order to increase its own abundance
	- western people produced an inhuman world for those in the third world and a dehumanizing world in the first world
	- an awakening is made possible by the world of the poor and victimized
	- fist world seems to know what is truly human about human beings: what is human is the "way we are," but they just want people to be like them. they assume full knowledge
	- fundamental differences in the way people live

- in order to comprehend our human essence, it is necessary to do so from the PV not of the powerful but of the poor, and on their behalf
	- *Father Ellacuria* would say that a more human civilization can be made concrete by...
		- considering first the community rather than the individual
		- by upholding transcendent values over crass pragmatism
		- by favoring celebration over mere diversion
		- by emphasizing hope over calculated optimism and faith over positivism

- to believe in God means to cease having faith in idols and to struggle against them
	- to speak the whole truth, one must say: in which God one believes in and in which idol one does not believe in
	- faith is difficult but entirely possible, that it is very costly but deeply humanizing
	- faithful response to this world of victims is the **constant exercise of mercy**
		- making someone else's pain our very own and allowing that pain to move us to respond
		- move by pity, not by a commandment

- in *El Salvador*, the author discovered some important things
	- we should know that in our world there are not just wounded individuals but crucified peoples, and that we should enflesh mercy accordingly
	- we must realize that mercy that becomes justice will automatically be persecuted by the powerful, and therefore mercy must be clung to vigorously and consistently
	- we must give mercy priority above all else
	- the exercise of mercy is the measure of freedom (for Jesus, freedom meant that nothing could stand in the way of the exercise of mercy)

**Summary:**

We have awakened from a sleep of inhumanity to a reality of humanity.

There is nothing as vital in order to live as a human being than to exercise mercy on behalf of a crucified people, and that nothing is more humanizing than to believe in the God of Jesus.

## Further Notes about the Reading

**"Awakening from dogmatic slumber"** refers to the liberation of the mind from subjection to authority.

This change was happening in modern Western Civilization at the time.

**"Awakening from the sleep of inhumanity"** is an awakening to the reality of an oppressed and subjugated world that leads to the liberation of peoples (which is the basic task of every person) from inhumane ways that hinder one from being human.

This happened to him and the people he lived with at the time.
