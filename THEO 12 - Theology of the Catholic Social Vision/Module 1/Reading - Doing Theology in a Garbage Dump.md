## The ground where we stand affects the way we see things (The Rough Grounds of Payatas and Elsewhere)

- "How do these rough grounds affect the way that I do theology?"
- "How do the questions and the painful lives of these people affect the way I think about God, salvation, morality, etc?"
- " If the Church still wants to walk the way of Jesus, it needs to listen to them because their lives alone already pose painful questions to the kind of salvation Jesus brings."

>We have got onto slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk, so we need friction. Back to the rough ground! (Philosophical Investigations)

By Ludwig Wittgenstein

- "The academe (which is the location for many of us) and our theories do not display real friction with actual life and death consequences."

## Their Lives as Painful Questions

- people in Payatas...
	- cannot have a church marriage, only
- liturgy
	- what is often asked to be done in church cannot be applied to the churches in Payatas...!
		- e.g. noise of dump trucks competes with singing of choir, "enter under my roof" without any roof at all...

## Closed Churches

- "The poor feels that the Church is a rigid, legalistic and "closed" institution."
	- e.g. woman in need of help went to the church, only to find that it was closed. instead, she found solace in the cemetery

---

## Closed Theologies

- "It is not only our churches and mentalities which are closed but also the way we do theology. It is these closed methods that make the Church deaf both to people's voices and to the whispers of the Spirit."

### Postmodern Theologies: Radical Orthodoxy

- John Milbank
	- created the book "Theology and Social Theory"
	- "Milbank was one of the first to unmask the metanarrative of human and social sciences and advocated its expulsion in theological discourse."
	- to recover the displaced Christendom
	- Milbank's project was intended to retrieve theology from its captivity in the social and human sciences.
	- *In the end, Milbank thinks we do not need other sciences - social science, even philosophy or metaphysics - because theology in itself suffices.*

### Liberation Theologies: Clodovis Boff

- Clodovis Boff
	- created the book "Theology and Praxis"
	- Boff's concern: it was to institute a theological method to protect liberation theology from the incursion of ideologies.
	- it is this content (voices of people from the ground) that serves as fuel to process the given "raw material" in order to come up with the "theological product"
		- Boff believes that the "raw material" is not very important; neither is the resulting pastoral action. What is really important is the act - the "theological production" done by the theologian. 

### The problem with both

- Both enthrone the "theologian" as the ultimate arbiter of theological meaning at the expense of voices from the ground.
	- theologian and their principles is at the center

## Reflexive Theologizing

- alternative to get out of these difficulties

>Science has a time which is not that of practice. For the analyst, time disappears: not only because the analyst cannot have any uncertainty as to what can happen, but also because he has time to totalize, that is, to overcome the effects of time. (The Logic of Practice)

By Pierre Bourdieu

- "Even mathematics which has gained a reputation for being the most exact science can never fully represent actual life."
- For, in the words of Bourdieu, academics are infected with what he calls the "scholastic point of view"

### Theological Reflexivity

- The life and death stakes of the poor are absent in their leisurely scholastic world, the world of the observer.
- To realize this is to step back and tell ourselves that not one of us can have the last word. That is "theological reflexivity". 
- Reflexivity is a structure rooted in the sociological and epistemological dimensions of our being human.

### Role of Praxis in Theological Method

- sensus fidelium
	- the voices, sentiments, reflections and praxis from the rough grounds are necessary to develop, change, modify or subvert the way we have formulated our doctrines, dogmas and beliefs
- in order not to pay mere lip service to sensus fidelium, viable processes need to be set up for the church to deeply listen to the faithful.
