## Introduction

"The signs of the times"

- attributed to Jesus in the Gospels (Mt. 16:3)
- generally refers to some public current happening which calls our attention to a significant change that is taking place in the world
- BUT, for us, it refers rather to important political, social or economic events or developments which are widely known but whose full significance may not be widely understood

It is usually assumed that the deeper meaning can only be grasped by those who 'read the sign' in the light of faith.

The reason why people are invited to read the signs of the times is to help them make a good discernment about how they ought to act.

## Signs ✔

These events or trends in the world are signs. This means that, if we read the 'signs of the times' correctly, we are being enabled by God to interpret more accurately what is really going on in the world, behind the superficial appearances.

As the moral theologian *Kevin Kelly* says, it involves "intelligently listening to the deepest hopes and desires, sufferings and anxieties, of the human family today." Consequently, it is not helpful to make too sharp a distinction between the signs as objective events and our subjective reading of the signs.

So, in reading 'the signs of the times,' we look first at our own feeling response and the reactions of the people. This is well put by *Kevin Kelly* who says, 'the signs of the times have to be felt.'

The implication here is that the Holy Spirit is evoking in us a reaction to what is happening- one that is similar in some degree to God's own reaction.

## Not a code!!! ❌❌❌

Some treats signs from God as though they could be deciphered in the way one could decipher a message sent in a code.

A genuine Christian 'reading' of the signs is something quite different from interpreting a code. It gives us some sense of how it fits into the unfolding of God's plan, which for the Christian is the coming of the Reign of God.

Despite all our effort to read 'the signs of the times,' we still see things only 'through a foggy mirror' (1 Cor 13:12). Nevertheless, even this dim and tentative sense of God's viewpoint gives us some guidance in our discernment.

## Which events are signs?

We need to accept that, if we are sensitive to the movements of the Spirit and in harmony with the mind of Jesus, then any event can be seen as such a sign.

A sign can be encouraging, while others can be alarming and may be seen as warnings from God. One example of a warning sign is the '9/11' attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001.

Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit we can interpret even the very frightening 'signs of the times' in the context of our Christian hope.

## Tentative...

It is important to hold in our minds that in all our attempts to read the signs, we are dealing with the mystery that Christians call God.

Furthermore, we have to allow for the fact that many of our judgments are made on the basis of unwarranted assumptions which we have failed to question.

## Faith, not divination

Reading 'the signs of the times' is an act of faith, not divination.

You 'read ' the meaning of the gift in light of your prior relationship with the other. In the same way, our reading of 'the signs of the times' is done entirely in the light of our prior faith and trust in God.

We are also assuming that God is communicating with us through what is happening- and that the message is one which is designed to help us.

Our attempts to read the mind of God is examining 'the signs of the times' in a way in which we manifest and deepen our faith and give expression to our preoccupation with the things of God.

This helps us in the process of discernment- but not in the obvious way of giving us clear instructions about how to act.

The most important element in our process of discernment is no longer our own attempt to read the signs; it is rather the movements of the Holy Spirits in our minds and hearts.
