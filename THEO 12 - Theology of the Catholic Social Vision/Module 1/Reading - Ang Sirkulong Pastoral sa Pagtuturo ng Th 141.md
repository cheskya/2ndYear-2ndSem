## Introduction

The Pastoral Cycle is a basic paradigm-tool used by teachers and students at the Ateneo De Manila. (It is also known as the Circle of Praxis.)

It refers to a single practical experience with four consecutive, inter-related, and unified moments, which constantly interact with each other.

This methodology was borrowed from the insights of:

- Paolo Freire
- Juan Luis Segundo S.J.
- the famous trilogy of Canon Joseph Cardijin (see-judge-act)

There are also four interrelated methodological steps in the task of doing theology, according to Bernard Lonergan, S.J.:

- experience
- understanding
- judgement
- decision

## Pagbababad sa Erya o "Insertion"

This refers to the students' actual immersion into the lives of a poor Filipino family. They leave their comfort zones and enter the lives of the poor to see Christ in them and experience a different world where the vast majority of Filipinos thrive today.

## Pagsusuring Panlipunan o "Social Analysis"

The purpose of this analysis is to understand, as fully as possible, the condition of the communities and the poor families with whom they stayed with.

This is the most important moment of the pastoral circle. It involves questions such as these:

- What happened to these people?
- What caused their poverty?
- What is the origin of this social injustice? Who benefits from it?
- What societal structures led to this?
- What are the different dimensions involved in this situation?
- etc.

The answers to these refer to what experts call a *synchronic and diachronic analysis* of society. Since no social analysis is value-free, it is necessary for students to be clear about their own values, which will influence their analysis.

## Pagninilay-nilay Teolohiko o "Theological Reflection"

This refers to reflecting on the socially analyzed situation (from [[#Pagsusuring Panlipunan o "Social Analysis"]]) from the POV of God's self revelation and the Christian's faith-response.

What does God's word, etc. say about this situation of social injustice, which in turn sheds light on this Revelation-Faith?

From this mutual interpretation (hermeneutic reciprocity) one can discern the meaning of a Theology of Liberation, which Gutierrez defines as a *critical reflection on Christian Praxis*. The older definition of theology as faith seeking understanding (*fides quarens intellectum*) is no longer enough.

It is also necessary to understand this Revelation-Faith within the total life context of believing Christians.

## Kilos-Pastoral o "Pastoral Action"

This aims to put into action what could be done to change the situation of injustice and insert themselves again in the community to avoid the "paralysis of analysis."

It is the duty of every Catholic and the Church to free people, as much as humanly possible from every oppressive social situation and promote the common good of each and everyone out of Charity.
