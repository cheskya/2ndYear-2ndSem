## Weaving Faith into Social Realities

Theological Reflection is the process of coming to "know" God by reflecting on God's world in the light of the resources of faith.

Theological Reflection enables the movement from reflection to action (kairos) and leads the participants to "new and transformative situations."

## Listening to the Cries of the poor and Oppressed

The starting point of Liberation Theology was the concrete situation: A climate of underdevelopment and oppression.

The Latin American Church reflected on this concrete situation, not just thru social analysis alone but most especially, thru the lens of the Christian faith.

> "Their faith told them that their poverty was not God's will; in fact the reality of their misery was due to profound social injustice."

These complaints reveal God's compassionate desire to liberate people from the realities that encumber them in experiencing a loving and fulfilled life.

How do our intertwined struggles converge with Jesus' deepest yearning for humanity?

## Jesus and His Vision for Humanity

Jesus builds the Reign of God from those who live in the margins and with those who are willing to give up everything to follow him.

This Jesus continues to be present in and among us today.

It is possible to discover this hidden presence when we learn to "read the signs of the times" together as a community.

This call invites and attracts us to consider Jesus' vision for humanity.

(It won't be easy, it may mean leaving our comfort zones!)

> "A person who attempts to discover a theology that liberates cannot afford to be an ivory-tower intellectual.Â  She or he has to become an organic intellectual, a theological activist, a pilgrim with the people of God. "
