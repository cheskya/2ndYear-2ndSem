Design a 2-bit shift register with parallel load using D flip-flops $D_1$ and $D_0$. There is one control input: Shift(SH). When Shift = 1, the content of the register is shifted by one position. There should be a serial input (SI). New data ($I_1$ and $I_0$) is transferred into the register when Shift = 0. Draw the logical diagram including the CLK Input.

(According to sir, right shift!)

Design a 4-bit synchronous binary counter using T flip-flops. Draw the logic diagram.

A 3-bit counter counts in the sequence: 001, 011, 111, 010, 110, 000, 100 and repeats. Show the state table and draw the logic diagram for a circuit that implements this. Use D flip-flops. Let the undesired state 101 transit to the desired state 000.
