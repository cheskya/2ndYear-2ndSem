A Boolean function can be expressed algebraically from a given truth table by...
1. forming a minterm for each combination of the variables that produce a 1 in a function
2. then taking the OR of all those terms

*Note:* Boolean functions expressed as a sum of minterms or product of maxterms are said to be in canonical form.

## Sum and Product
### Sum of Minterms
- defines the Boolean functions
- sum of those those which give the 1's of the function in a truth table

$\sum\limits{1,4,5,6,7}$

### Product of Maxterms
- maxterm is a complement of the minterm with the same subscript and vice versa

$\prod{0,2,3}$

## Conversion between Canonical Forms
yes. later...

$\sum\limits{1,4,5,6,7}$ = $\prod{0,2,3}$

- just get the complement, and then change summation to product
