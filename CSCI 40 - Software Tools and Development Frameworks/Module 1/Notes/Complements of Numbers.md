**Complements:**
- used to simplify the subtraction operation
- used to perform logical manipulation

There are two types of complements for each radix system:
- radix complement
	- AKA r's complement
	- e.g. for the binary number system, this is 2's complement
- diminished radix complement
	- AKA (r-1)'s complement
	- e.g. for the binary number system, this is 1's complement

*Note:* 1's and 2's Complement is for the binary number system.

## Different Complements of Numbers
### The 1's Complement
- replace 0's and 1's

### The 2's Complement
- add 1 to 1's complement

*Note:* 9's and 10's Complement is for the decimal number system.

### The 9's Complement
- subtract each digit from 9

### The 10's Complement
- add 1 to 9's complement

*Note:* 7's and 8's Complement is for the octal number system.

### The 7's Complement

### The 8's Complement

*Note:* 15's and 16's Complement is for the hexadecimal number system

### The 15's Complement

### The 16's Complement

## Subtraction with Complements
### Subtraction of two n-digit unsigned numbers
M-N in base r
- add M to r's complement of N
- if $M \leq N$, sum will produce an end carry
- if $M \lt N$, sum does not produce an end carry
