## Number System
- system of naming or representing numbers
- uses digits or other symbols in a consistent manner such that there is a unique representation of every number
- allows us to perform arithmetic operations
- parameters that define a number system
	- number of independent digits used in the number system
	- place values of the different digits constituting the number
	- maximum numbers that can be written with a given number of digits
- classified depending on the base of the system
	- radix/base - number of unique digits
