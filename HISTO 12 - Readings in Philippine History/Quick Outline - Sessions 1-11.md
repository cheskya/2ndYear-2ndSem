- Module 1 of Canvas Notes
*Questions:*
- What conflict did the early Philippine Revolution have?
- What were the two phases of the Philippine Revolution according to Teodoro Agoncillio? When did they happen?
- What happened at Biak-Na-Bato? When did it happen?
- How did the revolutionaries continue to strive for independence after being exiled?
- How revolutionary was the Philippine Revolution?
- What were the goals of the revolutions?

**Two Phases of the Revolution (Teodoro Agoncillo)**

- 1896-97 – led by the masses, represented by Bonifacio
	- After the Tejeros Convention, the elites captured the revolution and exiled its original leaders 
- 1897-98 (1902) – led by the elites, who would betray the revolution by signing with the Americans

**Pact of Biak-Na-Bato**

- signed on December 27, 1897
- led by Emilio Aguinaldo and Pedro Paterno
- what the revolutionaries wanted
	- Implementations of reforms – reduction of taxes, abolishing of polo   
	- Revolutionary leaders exiled to Hong Kong instead of arrested 
	- Nephew of the Governor-General will join the revolutionaries
	- Revolutionary leaders will receive 800,000 mexican dollars in three installments
	- Amnesty for all revolutionaries – 900,000 mexican dollars (reduced to 800,000) will be distributed to the revolutionaries that remain in the Philippines

**Hong Kong Junta**

- formed by exiled revolutionaries
- Aguinaldo had the option to choose... (Spanish-American War)

**Spanish-American War**

- Spaniards promised
	- to implement socio-economic reforms in PH
	- give Filipinos greater participation in gov
	- recognize Aguinaldo's status as a general and military leader
- Americans promised
	- to bring Aguinaldo back to PH
	- help arm the revolutionaries
	- provide some recognition to Aguinaldo's government
	- all promises were not put into writing

Aguinaldo chose the Americans

**Independence?**

- independence was declared in Kawit, Cavite in June 12, 1898
- but by June 18 not all of the Philippines would be in the hand of the revolutionaries (some Spanish-governed or self-governing)
- so why declare independence?
	- main audience is foreign countries
	- in Cavite, not Manila, because Spaniards are still there

**Features of the Revolution (So how revolutionary was it?)**

- not "plebian"
- liberal in orientation
- no goal beyond "unity" for the sake of overthrowing Spain
- suppressing social categories
- intra-class conflict (conflict within middle class, urban and rural elites)
- inter-class conflict after revolution (conflict between classes)
- peasantry conflict
- different leadership, same ideals

Not like the French revolution (bloody), but like the US revolution (perpetuated the empire, just shifted leadership)

**Goals of the Revolution (How can it still be revolutionary?)**

- political - kasarinlan
- social - kalayaan
	- kapatiran - brotherhood of all filipinos
	- kaguinhawaan - proper distribution of resources
	- kaliwanagan ng loob - enlightenment

kasarinlan is meant to lead to kalayaan...

...but we haven't really achieved kalayaan yet

(*Note:* July 6, 1900 - US colonial policy on separation of church and state)

- PowerPoint
*Questions:*
- When was the First Philippine Republic established?
- When was the First Philippine Constitution Ratified?
- What are the five conflicts experienced by the First Philippine Republic? What were the arguments on both sides for each one? Who supported both sides for each one?
- How does the First Philippine Republic work? What are the branches of government? How are responsibilities distributed?

June 12, 1898 - First Philippine Republic (same date as Declaration of Independence)

January 22, 1899 – first Philippine Constitution is officially ratified

*How did the First Philippine Republic operate?*

- **legislature** - creates laws
	- president of the assembly - pedro paterno (imposter...)
	- *note:* back then, the house was unicameral (now it's bicameral, containing the house of representatives and the Senate)
- **executive** - executes or implements laws
	- president of the republic - emilio aguinaldo
	- vice president - mariano trias
	- cabinet officials
- **judiciary** - interprets the law
	- chief justice - apolinario mabini (did not take office)
	- solicitor-general of the republic (lawyer of the government) (now this role is under the executive branch)
- how it works...
	- national assembly elects the president
	- president can veto laws
	- national assembly appoints the chief justice and solictor-general
	- supreme court can nullify passed bills
	- supreme court can declare policies unconstitutional
	- president confirms chief justice and solicitor-general
	- permanent commission may declare members of the executive and judiciary branch unfit for service and remove them from office (no impeachment back then)
	- SO BASICALLY?
		- legislative branch was still made very strong even though aguinaldo was a dictator (executive and judiciary couldn't check legislative members)

- head of government - executes policies
- head of state - a figure for the people (speeches, etc.)

**What should be Aguinaldo's role as president?**

- dictator (strong executive, head of government)
- figurehead (strong legislature, head of state)

**Union or separation of Church and state?**

- Union – state sponsors a specific religion, known as the state religion 
	- At the time, Catholicism as the state religion – Church has some political function
- Separation – no state religion, the state does not sponsor a specific religion 
	- Complete severance, no sponsoring or connections though the church can criticize the state in any way, shape, or form

**Who will control the armed forces? National or Local Government?**

- Local 
	- Traditional role of the Principalia
	- Ability to control the populace
	- “Imperialist” Manila
- National
	- Warlordism and regionalism 
	- Military loyalty

**How should the republic address the potential threat posed by the United States?**

- Attack
	- Americans are untrustworthy
	- There are few American soldiers in the Philippines
	- The US will eventually send reinforcements
- Negotiate
	- Threats from other colonial powers
	- So the US would be a potential ally
	- Foreign recognition

**How will the government fund itself? How about the masses?**

- funds increase the more property you own
- soldier and men in active service are free from tax, which is how the government got people for their army (although handicapped people and people over 60 were also free)

*Related resources:*
- [Gavin's Notes (Session 6)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xHkrErD4_WfeNPrvsBU8SvP2fxrATDznUxktA25vlOg/edit)
*Questions:*
- blah

**White man's burden**

- Filipinos need the Americans

**Myths that represent American perspective**

- manifest destiny
	- similar to "white man's burden"
		- white man's burden is helping other progress
	- they don't want to colonize the Philippines, but they did because it is their destiny and responsibility
	- according to them, God put the Philippines on the American's side
	- god-given destiny to colonize the philippines
	- killing the Filipinos was a sign of "love"
	- they KNOW they are colonizers, but they think they're exempted WHAT THE I'M GOING TO-
- white love
	- after territory expansion, americans view people they conquer as friends
	- sees themselves as elderly figures to the countries they conquer

**William Howard Taft**

- saw America as big brother to Philippines

**President William Mckinley**

- benevolent assimilation proclamation
	- americans came to the philippines as friends and mentors
	- help the philippines progress them further by liberating them from the spaniards

if advancing america, manifest destiny (their destiny to advance and colonize)

if colonizing people, white man's burden

if paternity, white love

if mckinely, benevolent assimilation proclamation

February 4, 1899 – tensions escalating to a full-scale war between Filipinos and Americans

(Americans would occupy Manila at the end of the Spanish-American war, which increased tension)

**Goals of the Filipinos during the war**

- make war unpopular to American public
- prolong the war for as long as possible, make sure that the Americans suffer high casualty count
- if Malolos falls, all military forces will transition to guerilla warfare
- hope that Mckinley loses the next presidential elections

**Division**

- Malolos Republic would suffer from divison
	- Luna wasn't popular at the time
	- Luna eventually assassinated
- Quick transition of members in the cabinet
	- replaced Aguinaldo with Paterno, a known Americanista
- Aguinaldo would be arrested
	- signaled end of Philippine-American war
	- also signaled the end of the first Philippine Republic and the end of resistance to American colonialism (but resistance would really continue until 1912) (Aguinaldo just represents end of elite resistance)
