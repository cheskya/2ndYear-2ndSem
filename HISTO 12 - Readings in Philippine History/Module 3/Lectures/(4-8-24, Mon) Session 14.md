## Economic

**PH Trade Act (1946)**

- preferential tariffs on US products
- US controls dollar-peso exchange rate (rate is fixed at 2 pesos for 1 dollar)
- parity rights given to American citizens
- raising sugar quota exports to the US

The exchange rate affects the market and trade relations. (if php is weak and us dollars is strong, exported ph products are cheap, so export ph products. else, make products for the local market.)

*Fiscal Policy* - how you raise revenue, how gov collects money, and how gov spends money (about revenue and expenditures) (handled by business of finance, finance secretary)

*Monetary Policy* - the amount of money that is circulating within the economy (handled by central bank)

**Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1955**

(i didn't see)

For economies, the steps are usually:

1. Agriculture
2. Industrialization
3. Service

- proposal is to import substitution
	- everything you import to the philipppines, you try to do at home
	- model is Argentina
	- gov doesn't need to pay much (fiscal) but peso should be high to encourage the local market (monetary)
	- proposed by *Cuaderno*

- proposal is export-oriented industrialization
	- produce goods not for filipino consumption but for international consumption
	- gov must pay more esp for infrastructure (fiscal) and peso should be low to sell the products to other countries (monetary)
	- proposed by *Araneta*

We followed import substitution.

For the presidential candidates:

- Garcia - stuck with import substitution
	- part of the generation of the corrupt officials lol...
	- not willing to change, saw Argentina as the richest country and stuck to it
	- presidents after the war were more willing to change because they weren't attached to the image of Argentina, but retracted it because the masses didn't like it (and because they'd have to tax the elites)
		- Argentina wasn't a part of the world war, this is an important factor to note. they were supplying goods

We embraced export-oriented industrialization during Martial Law, but it was too late. The price of oil skyrocketed (wars in the Middle East) which made goods more expensive to produce (we are not oil producing).
