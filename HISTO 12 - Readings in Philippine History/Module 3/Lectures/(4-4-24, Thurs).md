Session 14 is recorded.

Contradiction!

Japanese want to reunite the Filipinos through their one "inang wika," but use English and American-related concepts in their propaganda.

There's also an issue regarding profiteering.

Warning profiteers that sooner or later, FIlipinos will have their own gardens and profiteer will have no one to exploit.

Another issue about poverty!

Encouraging Filipinos to consider farming and return to the countryside (by making it appear profitable)

- For Filipinos, PH is inherently agricultural (within the countryside resides the true Filipino spirit)
- For Japanese, agriculture is an inherent part of the Filipinos as well

What happened to the collaborators?

Nacionalista party split after the war.

Some candidates died. (Quezon and Magsaysay)

Osmena and Roxas fought for the position of president, but McArthur didn't like Osmena because he was more of a businessman. He wanted someone more bold?

Osmena-Wing is the Nacionalista party.
Roxas-Wing is the Liberal party.

Osmena was never elected. Someone was elected because Quezon died. But Roxas won in the next one.

Post-war era saw the rise of warlords. Philippines was pretty weak after the war, so warlords controlled the weaker areas. In order to control provinces and areas, the government started franchising violence to local warlords. Also gave rise to local armies.
