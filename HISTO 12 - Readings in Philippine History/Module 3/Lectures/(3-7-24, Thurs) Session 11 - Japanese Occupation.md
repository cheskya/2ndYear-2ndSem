## East Asian Race
- dictated by our sameness
	- we all have the same East Asian culture; that is, we value family, etc
- BUT at the end of the day, the centrality of East Asia is still Japan
	- they are the first one to be modernized, therefore they are the best
	- notion of paternalism... they have the "responsibility" to civilize the rest...
	- "kokutai" - not an EQUAL community... more of a HIERARICHAL family (emperor as dad)
	- protect the other nations from Western imperialism
	- "daitoa" - greater east asia co-prosperity sphere

these contradict each other... (e.g. "everyone is the same here but you're more unicivilized than me lol. either way deep down we are all human and so i will help you.")

- culturalism
	- people should go back to their culture and tradition to negate materialism (the solution)
	- materialism directly related from colonialism
- modernism
	- inspired by Western countries
	- but made people forget their own cultures
	- corrupted people also because it promotes materialism
