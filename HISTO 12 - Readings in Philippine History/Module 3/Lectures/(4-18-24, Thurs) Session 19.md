**Two Types of Oligarchs (according to Winters)**

- Wild
	- oligarchs are uncontrolled
	- regulate institutions that is supposed to regulate them
	- e.g. political warlord
- Tamed
	- oligarchs are controlled by specific institutions (State, Church, etc.)

**Four Types of Oligarchy**

- Warring Oligarchy
	- purely composed of wild oligarchs
	- engaged in providing coercion that defends their wealth
	- often fragmented and individualistic
	- e.g. political warlords
	- e.g. Feudal Japan, Early 20th Century China, Feudal Europe

- Ruled Oligarchy
	- higher degree of cooperation between oligarchs
	- collective rule is institutionalized in a governing body exclusively composed of oligarchs
	- e.g. Italian Mafia, American Mafia, Early Athens, Roman Republic

- Sultanistic Oligarchy
	- single oligarch exercise rule in a direct and personal fashion
	- other oligarchs disarm to a significant degree either through coercion or cooptation
	- e.g. Marcos Regime, Suharto Regime

- Civil Oligarchy
	- oligarchs fully disarm, cease to rule directly, and hand over the task of wealth defense to an impersonal bureaucratic state
	- e.g. Contemporary United States
