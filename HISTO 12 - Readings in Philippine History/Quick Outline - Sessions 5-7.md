# Quick Outline
## Session 5: A Nation of Contradictions
- Contradiction A: What should be Aguinaldoâ€™s role as President?
	- Dictator (strong executive, head of government)
		- led by Mabini
		- this one won
	- Figurehead (strong legislature, head of state)
		- led by Calderon
- Contradiction B: - Union or Separation of Church and State
	- Union (state sponsors a specific religion aka state religion)
		- led by Mabini
		- this one won by one vote, but did not actually get taken into effect because of the Americans arriving
	- Separation (no state religion)
		- led by Aglipay
- Contradiction C: Who will control the armed forces? National or Local Government?
	- Local
	- National
- Contradiction D: How should the republic address the potential threat posed by the United States?
	- Attack
	- Negotiate
- Contradiction E: How will the government fund itself? How about the masses?
	- promised that they'd remove taxation after they gain independence, but reintroduced it anyway... (although this time they allow you to be free of taxation by enlisting in the army, which many people especially elites took advantage of)
## Session 6: The White Man is a Burden
(This one doesn't have any clear divisions...)
- May 1 1898 - Spanish-American War
	- occupied Manila by end of the war (which was why the first PH Republic was established in Malolos)
		- led to tensions
		- February 4, 1899 when tensions escalated to full-scale war
- Filipino-American War
	- goals of the Filipinos (Antonio Luna)
		- make the war unpopular to American Public
		- prolong the war as long as possible, make sure that Americans suffer high casualty count
		- if Malolos falls, all military forces will transition to guerilla warfare
		- hope that McKinley will lose the next presidential elections
			- opponent William Jennings Bryan was an anti-imperialist
- White Man's Burden
	- justifies the colonization of the PH
	- belief that Filipinos needed the Americans
	- belief that the White Man is responsible for bringing "civilization, democracy, and freedom" to other nations
- Myths that represent how the Americans view themselves
	- White Love
		- paternalistic form of love
		- did not want to occupy the PH but had no choice (image of older family figure caring for the PH)
	- Manifest Destiny
		- the US was destined to expand territory and spread freedom
		- irony - teaching others about freedom by depriving them of it, by colonizing and conquering them
	- *Note:* the American public however was against the intervention and occupation of the archipelago as it was mirroring what the Europeans were doing
- Benevolent Assimilation
	- from President William McKinley
	- claimed that the role was to help the Ph create their own nation (benevolent assimilation)
	- not an enemy of the PH, but as a friend that will help them end 300 years of Spanish colonization (not like other colonizers)
