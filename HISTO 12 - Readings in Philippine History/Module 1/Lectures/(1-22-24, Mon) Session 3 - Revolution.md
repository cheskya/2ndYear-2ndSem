## Important Points of History
### Latin American Wars for Independence
- also related to the Napoleon war
- led to Spain losing most of its colonies in America
- Philippines was the only one that was unprofitable, but needed to be profitable due to the situation, so Spain did a lot of reforms in it
### Instability of Bourbon Rule
- Alfonso returned as king
- Bourbon rule continued until he died
- when he dies, the kingdom argued about whether Carlos or Isabela should have the crown
### Carlist Wars
- war about whether Carlos or Isabela should have the crown
- Carlos
	- son of Alfonso
	- chosen by conservatives
- Isabela
	- daughter of Alfonso
	- chosen by liberals
	- after she won, she started to lean towards the conservatives as well, which caused political instability because of the conflict between liberals and conservatives

### Further: The Philippines during this time
- political instability in Spain affected the Philippines
	- liberals in power led to liberal reforms
	- conservatives in power led to many of the liberal gains being retreated
- creoles (mestizos and insulares) occupied important economic and political positions during that time

*Note:*
- mestizo is half spanish, half filipino
- insulares is spanish born in the philippines

## Reforms in the Philippines (from Spain)
### Opening of Manila to world trade
- anyone who wanted to trade in the port of manila was allowed to trade
- the suez canal opened from egypt, which meant that travel from asia and europe was easier and faster (made Manila a hotbed for ideas and concepts from Europe, mainly nationalism and liberalism)
### Creation of new infrastructures and institutions
- for economics
- e.g. precursor of modern philippine railway, bridges
### Urbanization and opening of new businesses
- hotel de oriente - first five star hotel in the philippines
- rise of cosmopolitan in the manila was affected by the urbanization
### Reforms in key institutions like education and public health
- productive colony = productive population -> need to give education and public health
- introduced reforms for education and public health
- spaniards was the one who introduced education and public health in 19th century
- ateneo municipal - one of the three first class schools (like santo tomas and leteran) (ust first and only westernized first class tertiary in the philippines and the far east or asia back then) (ateneo and leteran was first class westernized tertiary)
### Emergence of a new highly educated and urban middle-class
- *ilustrados* would emerge from this
- these reforms also resulted in multiple issues in philippine society
	- secularization issues

---

## The Secularization of the Philippines
### Priests Back Then
- *regular priest (friars)*
	- convert non-christians to christianity
	- member of a friar order (FDJRA)
		- dominicians
		- agustinians
		- fransiscans
		- jesuits
		- recollects
	- main task is to go to different parts of the philippines to convert yeah
- *secular priests*
	- who will remain in the communities that were converted to provide sacraments
	- not a member of a friar order
		- the only way to become this is if you are a spaniard
		- all indio priests are secular priests (impossible)
			- they got angry
			- this is a crucial part of philippine politics. filipinos are the one who is in charge of the politics of the philippines
			- principales in government (allowing filipinos to control the municipalities) (opens up chance for rebellion) (but they are controlled by the parish priests) (it is very important for colonial government to assure that parish priest is loyal to the government) (so it's better if the priest is spanish than filipino)
			- archbishop Basilio Santa Justa commanded that it was okay, but they (friars and government) refused because it was the only way to control the principales
			- became a bigger issue because many secular priests began demanding them to follow the order of the archbishop (secularization movement)

### Secularization Movement
- *pedro pelaez*
	- demands equality of regular and secular
	- saw it as an issue within catholic church
	- died because of an earthquake
- *jose burgos*
	- suceeded pelaez
	- saw the issue instead as an issue within the social society
	- said that they weren't allowed because they were filipinos
	- spanish gov was threatened
	- secularization movement masterminded by him
		- a lot of filipinos supported
		- but he died because of this
		- filipinos believed that reforms would only be accepted if they directly asked help from the king...? yes
	- died from execution (gomburza)
- *secularization*
	- transferring the leadership and management of the parishes from the regular priests to the secular clergy
### Ilustrados and "La Propaganda"
- this secularization movement led to the rise of a politically vocal middle class called *ilustrados*
	- they were able to study abroad
	-  the first to call all members of Philippines society "Filipinos"
- execution of gomburza convinced ilustrados that change within colonial gov is impossible and they need to demand reform directly from Spain
	- also beginning of La Propaganda
- nine demands

*Note:* Info about the views of Philippine History comes from "A Legacy of Propaganda: The Tripartite View of Philippine History" from Zeus Salazar.
#### Different Views
- what the spanish saw...
	- *bipartite* view
	- spanish describe pre-colonial period as time of darkness because no light of "civilization"
	- spanish describe colonial period as a time of enlightenment
		- so filipinos must have "utang of loob" to the spanish
		- and they must pay tribute to spanish
	- so darknesss is to pre-colonial as light is to colonial
	- their concept of light is attached to **christianity**
- but ilustrados see it as...
	- their concept of light is attached to **civilization and progress**
	- pre-colonial was period of enlightenment
		- when early Filipinos trade with neighbors in East and Southeast Asia
	- colonial period as an agreement between spaniards and filipinos
		- latter will give up freedom in exchange of the former's protection
		- spaniards failed to uphold their side of the contract, so colonial period is darkness...
	- post-colonial period
		- period when Philippines is no longer a colony of Spain
		- freedom of the Philippines
		- if agreement, then philippines becomes a province of spain. if not, then philippines becomes an independent nation
	- we call this view as the *tripartite* point of view
		- but they have different views still (leaders of the propaganda movement below)
			- **marcelo h del pilar**
				- biggest problem was the friars
				- pre-colonial
					- no enlightenment
					- need mother spain to civilize filipinos
				- colonial
					- encomenderos first charged with civilizing mission
					- civilization process attached to friars hidered progress
				- post-colonial
					- friars must go
					- revolution is good but liberal reform is better (integration of Philippines with Spain)
			- **graciano lopez jaena**
				- friars still problem, but filipinos have the capacity to keep progressing
				- pre-colonial
					- primitive state, but had a civilization and a degree of enlightenment
				- colonial
					- capacity for progress impeded by friars
					- progress only because of Filipinos
			- **jose rizal**
				- filipinos already had a civilization... spanish just impeding it
				- different from prev two because doesn't put all blame on friars, but puts blame on colonial system
				- pre-colonial
					- filipinos already had a civilization
					- maybe even more advanced than spanish
				- colonial
					- corruption and decay
					- priests were actually friendly (protecting the filipinos), but got corrupted because of colonialism
					- filipinos are hardworking, but system made them insolent
				- post-colonialism
					- counter is nationalism
					- tactically, should reform first
					- but if not, should be revolution
			- they couldn't vote a leader... so rizal went back to the philippines to establish la liga filipina
### "La Liga Filipina"
- established by rizal
- two factions
	- moderate
		- believed that laliga is a grp meant to support propaganda movement inn spain
		- apolinario mabini
	- radical fraction
		- andres bonifacio, deodato arellano
		- stepping stone towards a revolutionary movement
		- decided to establish a revolutionary group (KKK)
			- head of katipunan is the supremo (first was deodato arellano, then roman basa, then andres bonifacio) (first two didn't recruit enough)
- didn't work because rizal was arrested

### KKK or the Katipuneros
- "kataastaasang, kagalanggalangang katipunan ng mga anak ng bayan"
- the leaders of the katipunan actually are primarily middle class
	- **andres bonifacio** - urban middle class
		- group that emerged because of the economic reforms in 19th century
		- economic power came from being employed in local and international companies
		- has a strong liberal and internationalist outlook
		- most are ilustrados or semi-ilustrados
	- **emilio aguinaldo** - rural elites (principales)
		- strong influence esp in rural areas
		- economic power tied to political power and land ownership
		- while educated, politics mostly shaped by local experience
		- political power threatened by economic reforms of the 19th century
	- *urban middle class vs rural middle class*
		- bonifacio vs aguinaldo
			- as president
			- voted for kababayan aguinaldo
			- aguinaldo was leader of state cavite, and cavite was successful for the revolution?
			- bonifacio was nominated for every position and lost all of them except for secretary, but someone said that a lawyer was best fit for that position too
			- aguinaldo ordered to capture bonifacio because he was a counter revolutionary, which led to his execution
			- we celebrate bonifacio day on his birthday and not his death day because it is the filipinos who killed bonifacio
