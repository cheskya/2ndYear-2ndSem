## Review of Previous Lecture: The Revolution
- periods of revolution
	- first phase was 1896-1897
		- primarily led by the masses
		- represented by bonifacio
		- after this, aguinaldo was captured, led to biak na bato
	- second phase was 1897-1898
		- represented by aguinaldo
- because of this, conflict was often interpreted as *interclass* conflict
	- teodoro agoncilio - interclass view
	- vertical conflict
	- conflict between the masses and the elites
- but in reality, they belong to the same class (middle class), so it would be an *intraclass* conflict
	- jim richardson and jonathan fast - intraclass
	- horizontal conflict
	- conflict between middle classes
	- urban middle class becoming more and more powerful (moving up the ladder)
		- because of the urbanization of manila and therefore more international concepts are gained
		- but they can't reach the top because they're indios
	- meanwhile, rural middle class becoming less and less powerful (moving down)
		- principales losing power in their position
			- the position used to be hereditary, but after a while, not anymore

## Pact of Biak na Bato
- implementation of reforms and reduction of taxes and ending the polo y servicio
- revolutionary leaders will be exiled in hong kong
	- plus the nephew of the governor-general will join the revolutionaries (hostage)
- revolutionary dealers will receive a total of 800,000 mexican dollars (to be paid in three installments)
- amnesty for all revolutionaries
	- total of 900,000 mexican (later reduced to 800,000) dollars will be distributed to revolutionaries that remain in the philippines
	- but will only be given if they surrender the weapons
		- revolutionaries didn't want that, they buried instead

- hong kong junta
	- established by exiled in hong kong
## Spanish-American war
- provided aguinaldo the opportunity to *restart the revolution*
- use military of philippines to fight the spanish while aligning themselves with the americans
- the americans promised...
	- to bring aguinaldo back to the philippines
	- to help arm revolutionaries
	- to provide some recognition to aguinaldo's government
	- BUT all of their promises were not put into writing...
- but then! the spaniards promised...
	- to implement socio-economic reforms in the philippines
	- to give the filipinos greater participation in the government
	- to recognize aguinaldo's status as a general and military leader
	- AND these promises were put into writing...!
- **aguinaldo chose the american offer**
	- filipinos were actually the one who defeated the spanish in the spanish-american war...!

## Independence?
- aguinaldo declared independence, but...
	- the revolutionaries didn't actually control the entire philippines when they declared it
	- they only declared it to...
		- convince other countries that they have the power of the united states backing them up (and are "independent" from all of them)
			- so they distanced aguinaldo from it (he did not sign it)
			- they said it was embarassing djkgfjhsdgfjg
- they declared it at aguinaldo's house
- philippine revolution, which had a proletariat orientation, was betrayed when the ilustrados took over the Malolos Republic
	- from Agoncilio in "Malolos"
	- note: ilustrado is a status, not a social class

## Reading: How Revolutionary was the Philippine Revolution?
By Vicente Rafael
1. composition of revolution was not plebian nor proletariat
2. katipunan was liberal in orientation
3. because "middle class" goal was only unifying philippines to overthrow spain. no plan beyond this
4. goal of the revolution was "unity" and "homegeneity." **the goal was regime change not social change.**
5. the bonifacio-aguinaldo conflict was an intra-class conflict, not an inter-class conflict
6. inter-class conflict only emerged after revolution
7. malolos republic failed to adhere to demand of peasantry
8. no break between katipunan and malolos republic as agoncillo claimed
9. how revolutionary was the philippine revolution?

author also claims that the philippine revolution was closer to the american revolution. instead of a social change there was a political? change??
