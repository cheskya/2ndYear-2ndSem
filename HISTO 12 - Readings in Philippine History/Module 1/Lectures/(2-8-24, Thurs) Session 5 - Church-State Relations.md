*Related resources:*
- [[Reading - Church-State Relations]]

During the Spanish Colonial Period, Filipinos were defined to be Spanish people born in the Philippines.

Spanish Government - The Spanish Government having some control over the church. (Relationship of the Church and the Government within the colonies - Church will help Spanish empire, but the State can appoint officials within the parishes)

The solution?
Mabini proposed for the Filipinization of the Church
- our own church (separate from the vatican)
	- "Iglesia Filipino Independiente" or "Aglipayan Church" (IFI)
	- does not recognize the pope as the leader of the church
	- still has the same dogmas as the church
	- used to be an influential institution
		- the church of the poor
		- the church of the revolution

## Contradiction!
How should the republic address the potential threat posted by the United States

### Negotiate
- threats from other colonial powers (other countries might colonize if we don't get US protection)
- US is a potential ally
- might lead to foreign recognition

### Attack
- Americans are untrustworthy (should attack the Americans while they're still weak/few) (or else we might lose our independence)
- there are few American soldiers in the Philippines

established the academia militar
- the own military force of the Philippines
- how to fund?
	- well, they already promised they'd eliminate colonial taxation...
	- they eliminated MOST taxations but in exchange, introduced a new tax
		- imposed a war tax
			- man i'm not writing all those rules for the taxes
			-  the more property you have, the more you pay
		- borrowed loans (national loan)
			- which is why we need foreign recognition
			- however, since we didn't have that, they borrowed money from the elites instead
			- as collateral, they used the lands of the friar...

## The American Perspective
- manifest destiny
	- similar to "white man's burden"
		- white man's burden is helping other progress
	- they don't want to colonize the Philippines, but they did because it is their destiny and responsibility
	- according to them, God put the Philippines on the American's side
	- god-given destiny to colonize the philippines
	- killing the Filipinos was a sign of "love"
	- they KNOW they are colonizers, but they think they're exempted WHAT THE I'M GOING TO-
- white love
	- after territory expansion, americans view people they conquer as friends
	- sees themselves as elderly figures to the countries they conquer
- benevolent assimilation proclomation
	- americans came to the philippines as friends and mentors
	- help the philippines progress them further by liberating them from the spaniards

if advancing america, manifest destiny (their destiny to advance and colonize)
if colonizing people, white man's burden
if paternity, white love
if mckinely, benevolent assimilation proclamation
