reciprocity - gift and return

### Goals of the Revolution
- **political goal** - kasarinlan (initial goal)
	- external and internal sovereign
	- filipino control of natural resources
	- recognition of statehood and nationhood from other sovereign nation-states
- **social goal** - kalayaan (final goal)
	- kapatiran or brotherhood of all filipinos
		- may utang na loob sa mga magulang (similar to relationship of filipinos to their mother land / inang bayan)
	- kaguinhawaan or the proper distribution of resources among the populace
		- government will play a major role in this
	- kaliwanagan ng loob or enlightenment
		- respect for the dignity of each other and the willingness to help each other times of need
- *note:* kasarinlan will lead to kalayaan
	- in this context, the revolution of the philippines is indeed revolutionary
	- BUT it is a revolution that must not finish (and is still ongoing)

### Malolos Convention
- the revolutionaries chose Malolos to convene in
	- Manila was invaded by Spanish
	- they wanted a capital close to Manila and that they could defend
## Contradiction A
- what will be aguinaldo's role as president?
	- should he be a dictator (strong executive)?
		- mabini wanted this
			- strong legislature will lead to an oligarchy
			- the american question (if we go to war with the american's, we need quick and decisive actions) (argues that dictatorship will only be temporary)
			- the role of ilustrados in aguinaldo's cabinet
	- should he be a mere figurehead (strong legislature)?
		- calderon wanted this
			- strong executive is against liberalism
			- military loyalty (not loyal to the state, only to aguinaldo)
			- aguinaldo's experience in national governance and foreign affairs

*Note (the three branches of the government):*
- **legislature** - creates laws
	- president of the assembly - pedro paterno (imposter...)
	- *note:* back then, the house was unicameral (now it's bicameral, containing the house of representatives and the Senate)
- **executive** - executes or implements laws
	- president of the republic - emilio aguinaldo
	- vice president - mariano trias
	- cabinet officials
- **judiciary** - interprets the law
	- chief justice - apolinario mabini (did not take office)
	- solicitor-general of the republic (lawyer of the government) (now this role is under the executive branch)
- how it works...
	- national assembly elects the president
	- president can veto laws
	- national assembly appoints the chief justice and solictor-general
	- supreme court can nullify passed bills
	- supreme court can declare policies unconstitutional
	- president confirms chief justice and solicitor-general
	- permanent commission may declare members of the executive and judiciary branch unfit for service and remove them from office (no impeachment back then)
	- SO BASICALLY?
		- legislative branch was still made very strong even though aguinaldo was a dictator (executive and judiciary couldn't check legislative members)

*Note (head of government vs state):*
- **head of government** - executes policies
- **head of state** - a figure for the people (speeches, etc.)

## Contradiction B
- what will be the relationship of the church and the state under the republic?
	- should there be a union or separation of church and state?
		- a separation
			- mabini wanted this
				- liberal errr BLAH
			- what happens?
				- there is no state religion (does not sponsor a religion)
				- cannot use government funds to build religious structures
				- cannot tax churches
				- churches can still criticize government
				- priests cannot run for government (need to not be a priest first)
