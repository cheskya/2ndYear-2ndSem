# The Provincial and Municipal Elites of Luzon During the Revolution, 18898-1902

By Milagros C. Guerrero

Basically, there was a political reorganization established by Aguinaldo that led to elites maintaining their power and conflict between the military and civil officers. The elites are the victors of the Revolution, while the masses are unwitting victims.

## Introduction

One of the most obvious and significant features of the political situation during the years 1898-1902 is the emergence of these local elites as the real victors of the Philippine Revolution.

The events of 1898 had a tremendous impact on the Philippine elite, particularly the ilustrados. They had to shift their allegiance from the Spanish colonial government to the revolutionary regime established by Aguinaldo. But soon, they transferred this allegiance to the US.

Two months later, it became clear to Buencamino and other ilustrados in Luzon that the Philippine Revolution did not have the support of the US.

The ilustrados, however, recognized the uncertainty of the political situation. Though the cosmopolitan elite doubted that the Revolution would suceed, they extended their support to Aguinaldo. The latter, aware of the lack of talents among the active insurgent leaders, invited them to serve in his government.

## Establishment of Local Government

Aguinaldo called for the reorganization of Philippine provincial and municipal governments while the Spaniards were down.

Political reorganization, to them, would be the ultimate outcome of the victory of the Filipinos over their colonial masters and the logical step after the declaration of independence. It would prove to the outside world the Filipinos' capacity to govern themselves.

(I don't understand this paragraph at the moment. Something about Aguinaldo preferring underground governments.)

In contrast, political reorganization in the Bikol provinces was unusually placid. The revolution didn't spread to the region, nor was there any organized and widespread guerilla resistance during Aguinaldo's exile. It remained uneventful there even after Aguinaldo's return and the resurgence of the struggle against Spain in Luzon. They were aware of the declaration of independence but did not take action.

The elite of Western Visayas did not intend to recognize the supremacy of the Malolos Republic. There was not even a token recognition of Aguinaldo's leadership among the Negros elite. They did not follow Aguinaldo's instructions to establish a provisional government on the island, and did not send any delegates to the Malolos Congress when it convened in September 1898. Aguinaldo had to appoint others to present a picture of solidarity to the outside world.

## Challenges to Elite Dominance

Prominent citizens managed reorganization on their own terms while complying with the provisions of the presidential decree and with little opposition from the commissioners.

## Survival of Local Elites

They approved the election of officials who were obviously Spanish sympathizers.

In Cagayan... the officials accepted their positions but did not commit to the struggles of freedom that the other Filipinos had.

The continued entrenchment of political powerful families in some municipalities produced a negative reaction not only from rival principales who protested the system of politics but also from the common folk. A common cause of complaint was the lack of revolutionary fervour among these families and their perpetuation of corruption and abuse of power.

## Civil-Military Conflicts

With political reorganization, the functions of the civil and military officials became intertwined with each other. There would often be friction and conflict.

The functions of the military at times overlapped those of the civil officials, while confusion arose from the assertions of military officials that thye had the right to undertake the responsibilities of the latter.

Protests against the military were widespread, affecting most of the provinces in Luzon.

The central government was deeply troubled by the civil-military conflict but appeared unable to solve the problem.

## Alienation of the Masses

The conflict had a profoundly disturbing impact of the populace.

As the political elite were quick to claim the leadership of the Revolution, so too did members of the peasant masses demand that thye also should partake in the rewards of the Revolution through the implemntation fo good government and the abolition of taxes and forced labor.

Many peasants joined tax riots, demonstrations and messianic movements.

If the Filipino elite were the ultimate victors of the Revolution, then the masses in town and countryside were the unwitting victims.
