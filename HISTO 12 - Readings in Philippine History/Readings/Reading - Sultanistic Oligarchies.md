# Sultanistic Oligarchies

Chapter 4 of "Oligarchy" by Jeffrey Winters

---

A sultanistic oligarchy is a third mode of wealth and property defense.

Three elements are particularly prominent in defining sultanistic regimes.

First, sultanistic rulers govern personalistically and exercise extreme discretion over all political-economic matters of significance.

Second, sultanistic rulers maintain strategic control over access to wealth and deploy material resources as a key part of their power base.

Third, sultanistic rules strive to establish and maintain discretionary control over coercive power within the state or regime.

Oligarchs can usually use their material power resources to guard their fortunes against frontal threats.

## Indonesia

Concentration of wealth into the hands of oligarchs.

Although Suharto is long gone, oligarchy in Indonesia continues to be strongly influenced by the legacies of these origins.

## Philippines

Three differences between Marcos's sultanistic oligarchy and Suharto's

- not only were Filipino oligarchs a fully matured element of society prior to the sultanistic period, but they also thoroughly dominated the PH's politics as a stable ruling oligarchy for more than a century before Marcos seized power
- from the start, Filipino oligarchs were armed and played a direct role in the coercive aspects of wealth defense
- splits among Filipino oligarchs do not cut along racial-ethnical lines

Oligarchs gained an early foothold in the Philippines.

However, Spain’s approach in the Philippines was less invasive, treating the islands as a colonial afterthought until early in the nineteenth century when the galleon trade ended in the Americas. By the time the Spaniards decided to strengthen their grip on the colony’s economy and politics, a stratum of local oligarchs had already taken root and was growing immensely wealthy and powerful. 

The turning point in the nation’s oligarchic history came in 1836, the year sugar from enormous plantations owned by Filipinos became the colony’s chief export.

### Sultanistic Oligarchy under Marcos

Marcos's victory of a second consecutive term in 1969 disrupted the delicate balancing act at the heart of the nation’s electoral oligarchy. 

He redirected so much of the state’s resources to securing his advantage at the polls that he triggered a fiscal crisis on a level not seen since Quirino used similar maneuvers two decades earlier. 

### Wealth Defense under Marcos

Like Suharto, Marcos ruled through a combination of fear and rewards.

The president’s goal was not to eliminate Filipino oligarchs. It was to dominate, control, and tame them.

## Conclusion

At the start of the twenty-first century, Indonesia and the Philippines, despite the important differences in their oligarchic histories and the nature of their sultanistic regimes, are in some ways more similar polities than they have ever been before. 

The single greatest difference between the electoral ruling oligarchies in the Philippines and Indonesia is that oligarchs in the former constitute a far more violent force than in the latter.
