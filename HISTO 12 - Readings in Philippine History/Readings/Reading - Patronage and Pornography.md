# Patronage and Pornography: Ideology and Spectatorship in the Early Marcos Years

By Vicente L. Rafael

This essay is about the authoritarian wishfulness that emerged during the early period of the Marcos presidency, with particular concern as to the ways in which the Marcoses and their supporters produced and disseminated the couple's tendentious reconstruction of history.

(That Imelda Marcos would become so important in her husband's career was an indication the extent to which national politics had become a stage for playing out a generalized nostalgia for patron-client relationships a nostalgia fashioned to focus upon the first lady as a prototypical sign for the simulation of patronage within the amoral context of commodity exchange.)

## Introduction

In the aftermath of the February 1986 "revolution" that forced Ferdinand and

Imelda Marcos out of the Philippines, the government of Corazon Aquino

turned the presidential palace, Malacanang, into a museum and in doing so

meant to put the Marcoses legacy of excess on display.

Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos thought of themselves as Malakas and Maganda from the myth of the first Filipino man and woman who emerged from a large bamboo stalk. So much, in fact, that they had portraits of themselves done as Malakas and Maganda in the palace.

Huh?!

- As Malakas and Maganda, Ferdinand and Imelda imaged themselves not only as the "Father and Mother" of an extended Filipino family; they could also conceive of their privileged position as allowing them to cross and redraw all boundaries, social, political, and cultural.
- They likewise thought of themselves as being at the origin of all that was "new" in the Philippines.
- To the extent that they were able to mythologize the progress of history, the couple count posit themselves not only as an instance in the circulation of political and economic power, but they could also conceive of themselves as the origin of circulation itself in the country.

## A Man of Destiny, A Woman of Charm

Appropriating the legend of Malakas and Maganda was one way that the Marcos regime sought to set itself apart from its predecessors.

The turning of politics into a spectacle...!

We can see this obsession in the ways Ferdinand and Imelda's private and public careers were represented.

- Ferdinand often referred to his wife as his "secret weapon."
- Both were adept at working their audiences
	- People were more attracted to the sound of his voice than the content of his speeches.
	- Meanwhile, Imelda looked like an actress putting on a stage appearance.
- Turned their private lives into a public spectacle.

Something something about their private life aka romance. Ferdinand as a sexually active bachelor. "Blah blah you must be careful in choosing a woman, she will ruin you in politics if you're not careful." "Blah blah blah struck with desire seeing Imelda."

What is striking about the various narratives of the Marcos romance is the way in which they all indicate the presence of others watching the process of the "Matrimonial Alliance" develop.

The chronicling of the Marcos romance, like the identification with the legend of Malakas and Maganda, was part of their larger attempt to manufacture their pasts.

Marcos:

- Every detail of his (Ferdinand Marcos) life is seen from a single vantage point: his future as president of the Philippines.
- It's as if everything that has happened in his life was meant to happen.

> Biography merely confirms destiny so that the past becomes simply another version of the future.

Imelda:

- Stresses the element of luck in her climb to power (Seems to have left the future to chance)
- Until she met Ferdinand, her involvements with other men seemed to have had no certain trajectory, least of all towards marriage.
- "It was she who filled that gap- the need to make her husband more popular-because she was not just a woman but a special kind of woman whose natural charms were lethal." (Pedrosa, "The Untold Story")

Whereas his claims are couched in the idiom of an irresistible destiny, her power consists of projecting a certain kind of natural charm.

Through Ferdinand, Imelda discovers politics as a way of articulating her ambitions in ways that would not have been otherwise possible. In doing so,
she came to see her power as the result of submitting to the destiny of her
husband.

## Film and Female Ambition

Imelda Marcos's deference to her husband's ambitions was in some ways quite traditional and expected. Other first ladies have done the same.

What was spectacularly different about Imelda, however, lay in the amount of attention that she attracted and cultivated.
