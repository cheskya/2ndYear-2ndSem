Chapter 7 of "Philippine Politics and the Marcos Technocrats"

By Teresa Tandem

This chapter provides a glimpse of what inevitable challenges the Marcos technocrats had to hurdle as they were brought into the perfidies of an authoritarian regime, such as the issue of corruption of Marcos's relatives and cronies and the kind of leverage they had in dealing with these, like the nature of the support they received from the president and the IMF/World Bank.

Vocabulary and/or Concepts:

- Technocrat
	- government by technicians (experts in a field) who are guided solely by the imperatives of their technology. ([Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/topic/technocracy))

## Pre-Martial Law Technocrats Segue Into The Martial Law Administration

Pre-Martial Law, the Marcos technocrats seemed to be able to get what they wanted, albeit at an incremental pace.

They were caught by surprise by martial law. They believed that there was no need for it as they had no problem dealing with the members of Congress in getting the laws they wanted for their economic policies.

The technocrats were left out of the loop by the leadership concerning the planning of martial law. Despite this negative view, the technocrats, in general, welcomed it. A major reason was that they perceived that their policies and programs would no longer be subjected to congressional debates. (An opportunity to change things in the PH!)

### The Continuing Economic Role of the Technocrats

The fact that Marcos kept his pre-martial law technocrats in the dark about declaring Martial Law highlighted that he didn't see them as a political threat. They would still be part of his political project.

By keeping them, Marcos continued to see their economic value (point persons in dealing with IMF and World Bank)

## Powerful Factions Impinging on Technocratic Policy-Making

There were new technocrats who were not part of the pre-martial law technocracy faction headed by Virata.

There were conflicts between these new factions and older one.

### The "Chief Cronies" Bloc

Although the pre-martial law technocrats no longer had to deal with the "warring" political families and their respective economic interests with the abolition of Congress, another formidable challenge that confronted them was the emergence of the Marcos "cronies", particularly the president's "chief cronies," who controlled the coconut and sugar industries.
