Quezon was seemingly willing to block the decades-old dream of attaining independence in order to ensure his continued hegemony in domestic politics.

This is a study of how Quezon used this opportunity to strengthen his political position, and how the Filipino social -political system allowed such an action to occur.

## History of Manuel Quezon
### Gaining Power
- born August 19, 1878
- good education
- fought the Americans as an insurrecto
- passed bar exams and was appointed Fiscal (prosecuting attorney)
- dabbled in pro-independence parties, especially Partido Nacionalista (the party that all those parties merged into)
- became close friends with Sergio Osmena, who would emerge as leader of the Nacionalistas
- Osmena sent Quezon to Washington as the Philippine Resident Commissioner for the US
- disseminated Filipino desire for independence, created the newspaper "The Filipino" with the support of American Anti-Imperialist League and "many important figures in the Democratic Party"
- swing in American politics towards the Democratic Party produced both the "Filipinization" of the PH bureaucracy under Gov-Gen Francis Harrison and a growing Congressional sentiment in favor of PH independence
- in 1912 Democratic Congressman William Atkinson Jones introduced a bill providing for PH independence, but it failed to get out of committee
- another "Jones Bill" failed, so the next time they passed it they attached the Clarke Amendment, which guaranteed that independence would be granted within 5 years
	- Quezon wanted the Jones Bill since 1912 but didn't like the Clarke Amendment. Osmena agreed
- but private memoranda shows Quezon's growing concern that immediate independence might be detrimental to the PH and to ilustrado control
- Quezon still returned to Manila claiming sole credit for the Jones Act (passed w/o Clarke Amendment) and was greeted as a national hero
- Osmena skillfully managed to obtain the leading position in the newly created Council of State still, thus reaffirming control of the party and temporarily thwaring Quezon's avance in domestic politics

### Gaining Power: Take Two
- in 1919 Quezon returned to Washington as head of the first PH Independence Mission, hoping to obtain further concessions from the Democrats which might enable him to supplant Osmena
- took with him the "Declaration of Purposes" which reiterated the deman for independence
- Quezon pleaded the Filipino Case to Secretary of War Newton Baker with the help of Gov-Gen Harrison (Baker was sympathetic and said that Wilzon would work for PH independence)
- in 1920 Wilson told the Congress that a "stable" gov existed in the Islands and that it was the duty of the Congress to keep its promise to the people by granting them independence (but his efforts were fruitless, so Quezon decided to return to the PH to challenge Osmena directly)
- newly-appointed Gov-Gen Leonard Wood's constant pressure on Filipino elite caused dissension within Nacionalista party
- Quezon publicly blamed Osmena for the disintegration of the party, which was successful in getting him elected President of the Senate
- turned around and obtained a rapprochement with Osmena which lasted for a decade

### Power Achieved
- Quezon, now the most powerful Filipino politician, sent several independence missions to Washington, but presidents were impervious to any pleas
- later in 1927 he was incapacitated by tuberculosis. enforced isolation allowed him to take an overview of the PH-American situation. during illness his views on the possible problems of a premature independence began to solidify
	- watched growing militarism of Japan and worsening Depression
	- one of the first Filipinos to recognize these phenomena that had profoundly altered American policy towards the PH (independence was becoming a real possibility)

### The Possibility of Independence
 - with the coming of the Depression, every sector of the American economy began to suffer, and many Americans began to see the PH as a liability
- Western states began lobbying to restrict Filipino immigration because their unemployed labor pool already exceeded the critical limits
- they also proposed that the free entry of PH goods be curtailed
- in January 1930, Senator William King of Utah presented the Senate with a bill for immediate independence
- in March, Senator Harry Hawes and Senator Bronson Cutting introduced a bill which provided for the popular election of a Philippine constituent assembly to construct a constitution. by the provisions of the Hawes-Cutting Bill the Philippines would remain under lenient American control for five more years, during which time the free trade between the United States and the Philippines would gradually be abrogated by the introduction of steadily increasing tariff walls.

### Quezon's Back and Forth
- agreed with Hawes-Cutting bill now and wants to educate Filipinos to go slow
- Filipinos don't like that
- with the concern of losing political power, he settles on the platform of immediate independence for the philippines

Quoting this paragraph because it sums up what Quezon wants to do next:

When the Hare and the Hawes-Cutting Bills had become the basis for discussion for an independence bill in the American Congress, Quezon had formed two definite concepts about Philippine independence. First, Quezon wanted to be the leader of a politically autonomous Philippine Legislature but wanted the Philippine economy to have United States protection. Second, Quezon was willing to undermine his political comrades' efforts to attain independence because he felt that he alone should liberate his people. Quezon continued undermining the OsRox Mission for the next two years until the political battle between Quezon and the OsRox Mission, called the pro- anti- fight, ensued in 1933.

(OsRox refers to Osmena and Rozas btw)

The pro- anti- fight was waged to determine two things: on the superficial level it was to decide what course Philippine independence would take, and on the more profound level it was to decide who would become the leader of the Filipino people.
