## Origins of Rebellion

The population increased and most people needed to farm in order to live, so they turned virgin land into cultivated fields. But whereas the amount of usable land was finite, the number of people continued to grow

- Nueva Ecija
- Tarlac
- Bulacan and Pampanga
Land scarcity necessitated the farming of less fertile land, which people previously would have rejected.

By 1930s, the peasantry was desperate for land. Landowners realized they could make money from cash crops. They reasoned that by using their land, their capital, and their tenants' labor more efficiently, they would have more harvest to sell.

Capitalisms picked up speed in the twentieth century. Landowners in Central Luzon helped with the spread. Land ownership became a means to wealth. Central Luzon consistently produced more rice than people living there ate..

Rice and sugar cane thrived etc.

Large landowners were the ones who prospered form the rice and sugar boom. Peasants barely had enough for subsistence

By imposing strict rules and contracts, denying rations and other loans, hiking rents, and doing other manipulations, landlords extracted more from the peasantry, gave less in return, and passed down to their tenants and laborers losses they encountered.

Important changes during the American occupation:

1. local elite's relationship to the community
3. impact of an expanding central government on rural society (affected peasants adversely)

Significant illustration here was the government's policy to survey and properly title all land in the Philippines (accrdg to Western law.)

This strengthen further the landlord's hand and weaken the tenant's.
