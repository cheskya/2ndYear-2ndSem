## Introduction

(see p.1 of digital copy)

Philippine Revolution

- divided into two phases
	- rebellion against Spain (1896-1898)
	- Filipino-American war (1898-1902)

### The Rebellion Against Spain

(see p.1 of digital copy)

- initiated by the Katipunan
	- founded in Manila in 1892
	- concentrated in the Tagalog region
	- received wide and enthusiastic support form Manila urban society and surrounding municipalities e.g. Cavite
	- leadership made up of Manila urban middle sector, mostly non-ilustrados
	- later on... leadership went to the municipal elites
	- few ilustrados joined the Katipunan
	- for most wealthy ilustrados (many propagandistas) viewed the Katipunan as a potentially dangerou slower-class movement
- wealthy manila residents were arrested and imprisoned by the Spaniards
- leadership struggle ensued between Andres Bonifacio (Magdiwang Council) and Emilio Aguinaldo (Magdalo council)
	- resolved in May 1897 by an election
	- Aguinaldo won, Bonifacio executed
- Spanish troops unable to defeat the Filpino rebels
	- led to Pact of Biak-na-Bato
- peace did not return to the Philppines
	- most remained loyal to Spain
	- until early 1898 (rebellions of varying intensity broke out all over the Philippines)
		- most were local in nature, not a national struggle
	- before these outbreaks were resolved, *war broke out among the Spanish and the Americans*

### The Arrival of the Americans

(see p.2 of digital copy)

- Adm. George Dewey's Asiatic Squadron arrived at Manila Bay
	- May 1898
	- reinstated Aguinaldo at the head of the struggle
		- Aguinaldo received support from them
	- Spain lost its Philippine Colony to America
	- declaration of independence
	- rapid progress towards the establishment of a revolutionary government
	- military successes of the Filipinos against the Spanish forces
	- more Filipinos convinced that Spanish rule was over
- revolutionary government
	- received more support from municipal and provincial elites throughout Luzon, as well as from a large number of wealthy urban ilustrados
	- leadership was permeated with prestigious ilustrados
	- ilustrados did not succeed in gaining complete control, but they DID redirect it to serve their conceptions of the Philippine struggle and their vision of the future
	- at the same time they facilitated efforts to gain a truly national constituency for the nascent Republic
- it became painfully clear to many Filipinos that the United States had no intention to serve as the protector of the republic
	- US negotiated for the acquisition of the Philippines in its treaty with Spain (accomplished by 10 December)
	- after thirteen days, President William McKinley released his Proclamation of Benevolent Assimilation
	- General Elwell Otis built up his reinforcements in preparation for the eventual military conflict
		- in a carefully planned attack that was designed to favorably influence the US Senate's ratification of the Treaty of Paris, Otis's force moved aggressively against all the Filipino positions around Manila
		- Filipino-American War that ensued continued with varying degrees of ferocity for more than three years
		- in the midst of this, *some Filipinos and Americans reached an accommodation and eventual collaboration* that suited the aspirations of the former and the designs of the latter

---

## Accommodation and Early Collaboration in Manila

(see p.3 of digital copy)

(four months before outbreak of hostilities with the Americans) a group of prominent delegates to the revolutionary Congress at Malolos proposed that the Filipinos adopt a position calling for an autonomous government under an American protectorate

- position was not well received by the leaders (American motives unknown)
- but still, a lot of ilustrados liked the idea of autonomy (mostly Manila urban elites) (opposed the impending military struggle with US)

### Distrust in the Filipino Government

(see p.3 of digital copy)

many wealthy ilustrados lacked confidence in emerging Filipino government

- doubted leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo
- feared ascendancy of the "military element"
- possibility of increased participation in gov by members of old Katipunan
	- perceptions n goals differed from those of the urban, western-educated Filipinos
- (related to previous point) ilustrados believed only they were the ones qualified to run the government
	- advice sought and egos soothed through the legislative assembly
	- but they realized that their influence was very limited
- only small number of ilustrados and fewer wealthy Manila residents chose to fight the US
	- they were convinced that a war for independence would utimately fail and disrupt the economic system that sustained many of them
	- disenchantment with Aguinaldo was also excaberated by the realization that the Americans were not favorably inclined to support or protect his government
	- many withdrew their support and turned to the United States for protection
		- instead, they envisioned Filipino progress and development in terms of a close relationship, if not actual union, with the United States
			- people who had this position were referred to as *americanistas*
		- few conceived of an independent Philippines capable of standing on its own. but prominent among ilustrado aspirations was the desire to increase Filipino participation in the colonial government
			- and yes very few Filipinos actually desired the annexation of the Philippines by the United States. so instead, they advocated for Filipino autonomy under an American protectorate (the most practical position of ilustrados and wealthy Filipinos who chose peace over war)
- what remained uncertain early in 1899 was just how large a role in government the Americans would permit educated Filipinos to play
	- they could be reasonably sure that they would allow the separation of church and state
	- uncertainty about American objectives was however less worrisome than Aguinaldo government or a war against the Americans
	- but *uncertainties were cleared away* in March 1899 with the arrival of the Philippine Commission under Jacob Schurman (Schurman Commission)

### The Filipinos and Americans

(see p.4 of digital copy)

- Schurman Commission
	- led by Jacob Schurman
	- no executive authority and functioned mainly as a fact-finding body
	- BUT represented the US president and acted as a sounding board for prominent Filipinos residing mainly in Manila
	- held meetings with prominent Filipinos residing mainly in Manila
		- Schurman says...
			- the problem was to reconcile American sovereignty with Philippine autonomy
		- the Filipinos learned that...
			- the Americans had no intention to withdraw from the PH in the near future
			- they envisioned a colonial government that would depend, to a considerable extent, on Filipino participation at all levels.
	- greatly facilitated the development of a more throughgoing collaborative arrangement in the second half of 1899
- civilian court system
	- a supreme court had been established
	- ilustrados were appointed to prominent positions in these courts
- Bourns
	- worked under General Otis (Manila) and later General Robert P Hughes (Visayas)
	- would play a critical role in the formation of the [[#The Founding of the Partido Federal|Partido Federal]]
	- key figure in early Filipino-American relations in occupied Manila
	- devoted considerable effort to gathering intelligence on Filipino elites in Manila and elsewhere
	- primary liaison between Otis and an important Filipino delegation from Negros
- General Arthur MacArthur
	- successor of General Otis
	- also operated quite effectively in his interactions with the prominent Filipinos of Manila, trusted by a lot
	- military governor
- network of Manila-based ilustrados and urban elites
	- not revolutionaries and had little sympathy for the revolutionary struggle
	- also had substantial economic interests to protect
	- making peace with the Americans was their only practical alternative
- changing atmosphere
	- newspapers for the first time could treat many issues that had been too sensitive or restricted during the past regime
	- friars lost their influence with authority structure of the state
	- variety of newspapers were appearing in Manila
	- Rizal's novels could be purchased and read openly without fear
	- Anti-Spanish dramas become a popular diversion and a medium for nationalistic expression
	- the founding of the Liceo de Manila
		- a Filipino-run secondary school devoted to the proper education of the country's youth
		- represented a continuing concern for secular education in the Spanish language
		- a clear indication that the founders had rejected the military struggle and were now committed to the peaceful pursuit of their aspirations under American sovereignty and within the framework of American ground rules
			- many of the founders had been involved in the early organization of the revolutionary government and the educational institutions established under its auspices
	- the funding of Escuela de Derecho
		- Filipino law college designed to complement the Colegio de Abogados
	- popularity of Liceo de Manila and the Escuele de Derecho spread rapidly and both played important parts in the early response of urban-based ilustrados to American rule

## The Founding of the Partido Federal

(see p.7 of digital copy)

### Political Atmosphere under American Rule

(see p.7 of digital copy)

- atmosphere of excitement and anticipation among the politically motivated ilustrados, heightened by...
	- arrival of Taft Commission
		- realization that the members of the civilian body would take over the legislative and executive functions of the government
			- more complex group of aspiring ilustrados began to complicate the political scene, wanting recognition and leadership and introducing competition
	- also due in part to the return of several prominent figures that had remained associated with the Philippine republic
		- number of important generals were captured or had surrendered
		- many noncombatant officials of Republican government and a number of writers for the revolutionary press were captured, surrendered or filtered back into Manila
			- new aspirants to leadership were Paterno and Buencamino
				- openly withdrew their support from the Republic
				- took the loyalty oath
				- assured Americans of peaceful intentions
				- quickly launched a series of assertive actions to convince the American authorities that they were more genuine spokesmen for the Filipino elite than those currently enjoying the confidence of the commission
				- adopted the political position popular with most ilustrados (autonomous Filipino gov under American sovereignty and protection)
				- stressed their unique abilities to lead the peace movement and to share in the government at the top
				- objectives
					- replace the early collaborators in American favor
					- instinctive reaction against the annexationist provition prevalent among the leaders of the Americanistas
					- failed because of inexperience in dealing with Americans and their somewhat checkered political pasts and pretentious personalities
				- conducted a peace fiesta also
					- initially got a favorable response
					- boycotted by the Americans and failed when it was discovered that the speakers would use the opportunity to make nationalistic pronouncements that the new colonial rulers found unacceptable
				- underestimated the ability of the leading Americanistas to maintain a solid relationship with the new ruling clique among the Americans
					- leading Americanistas behaved as insiders
					- opinions of Taft and his colleagues were strongly influenced by these ilustrados
					- ilustrados were deserving of American support and trust
					- by appearing to avoid partisan politics, these ilustrados further pleased their American colleagues and increased their acceptance within the ruling circle
- during the second half of 1900, Manila's elite society was alive with political activity centered around *the emerging collaborative relationship between the highest American civil authorities and the favored Americanistas*

### The Creation of the Partido Federal

(see p.8 of digital copy)

- Partido Federal
	- group that garnered the most support primarily because of the obvious American backing enjoyed by its leadership
	- among the leading figures:
		- Paterno
		- Buencamino
		- Leon and Fernando Guerrero
		- Aguedo Velarde
		- Joaquin Luna
		- THAT'S TOO MANY NAMES SORRY
	- tried to aggregate politically active ilustrados that were not yet associated with the annexationists
		- e.g. former officials and military personnel of the Philippine Republic
		- some resident Spaniards (creoles) found little sympathy with the annexationist position too (desired to wrest the influence from the Americanistas)
		- some of these people anticipated the positive political realignments that would occur if President McKinley was defeated in the coming election and his "anti-imperialist" opponent WIlliam J. Bryan came to power
			- this later didn't come true, and shattered their hopes
		- didn't form any formal political organization but maintained their stance
		- however Paterno and Buencamino engaged more directly in maneuvers to establish an organization under their leadership
- American elections
	- defeat of Bryan and the reelection of McKinley
	- shattered the hopes for an early American withdrawal from the Philippines
	- political forces moved rapidly in Manila after the American elections
	- convinced that no further political advantage could be gained by continuing the military struggle, general agreement was reached among nearly all the Manila-based elites that a concerted effort should be made to end the war
		- broad-based political coalition was worked out among a number of leading ilustrados
- large contigent of Filpino political forces coalesced around the conservative Americanista leadership
	- Buencamino closed ranks with these leaders and played an important part in the final negations
	- Paterno reluctantly allowed himself to be drawn into the coalition (practical thing to do)
- la democracia
	- reorganized and reissued organ of the Partido Federal (newspaper)
	- reemerged as the Federalista organ
- a large group of "irreconcilable" detainees were deported to Guma
	- little sympathy and less support for revolutionary cause remained in Manila
	- however, provinicial and municipal elites elsewhere were identifying with the Aguinaldo government and increasingly organizing to resist the norteamericanos (? this is unreadable)
- Filipino-American war spread throughout the archipelago
	- in many provinces American troops did not arrive on the scene to challenge pro-Republic forces until the first half of 1900
	- Filipino forces in the province had little success in stopping the American military advance
	- BUT forced the Americans to scatter their troops far and wide and bogged them down in a frustrating and costly guerrilla war
	- persistence of provincial resistance kept the nationalist struggle alive and at the forefront of public discourse throughout the archipelago
- in the two large regions of the southern Philippines (centered in Cebu and Iloilo), great majority of urban and provincial elites remained aloof to the Republic
	- more regional stuff that i am too lazy and tired to write
	- basta they resisted, especially in Batangas
	- while in Luzon, they accommodated the new rulers
	- by early 1901, significant portions of the urban and provincial elites were everywhere beginning to adjust to the reality of American rule
- as war died down, the American civil authorities began to play a more prominent role in Philippine political affairs, both at the national and local levels
	- by September 1900, the commission had taken over the legislative function of the PH gov
	- and by the end of the year, they also took responsibility for the policies, form, and composition of the emerging civil government
	- Taft's primary concern was to bring an end to hostilities
		- demonstrate to wealthy, educated and politically motivated Filipinos that Americans had every intention of sharing the government with them
		- Filipino elites were being asked to accept a condition that promised to sustain, even enhance, their conomic position while offering more political participation than they enjoyed under Spain
