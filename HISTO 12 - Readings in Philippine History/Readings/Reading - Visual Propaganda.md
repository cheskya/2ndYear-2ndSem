## Propaganda in the First Month of War

When the war broke out, the Filipino response was overwhelmingly to stand up and fight. The Philippines had been attacked without warning shortly after Pearl Harbor was bombed, and the outrage was felt nation-wide.

This was reflected in stirring images of Filipinos-- and Americans together in some cases-- armed and ready to fight.

The aims of the Filipino early war visual propaganda were to vent out the anger and sentiments of the Filipinos, and to inspire them to fight by giving meaning to the struggle.

Propaganda...

- was full of anger
- consisted of people armed and ready to fight
- aired out the struggles and sentiments of the Filipinos
- showed the Japanese as bad, and suggested that Filipinos had to fight for their honor

## Japanese Propaganda

The Japanese invading armies also has their own propaganda plan.

The leaflets they brought with the first waves explained their cause. Others tried to convince Filipinos why siding with the Americans was wrong. (Reminded Filipinos of the atrocities of the Filipino-American war, and of how brutally the Americans had conquered the Philippines.)

They at first used sex as visual propaganda, but it failed because the Filipino soldiers on the front line were literally starving. What did have more impact were leaflets that showed good food around the island fortress of Corregidor.

Organized resistance ended with the invasion and surrender of the island fortress of Corregidor in May 1942. One propaganda line was to show how Japan really went to war to free the Asian peoples. (Japan as the leader of Asia.) Other posters sought to impress the Filipinos with Japan's unrivaled military and naval strength, and war maps boasted of Japan's victories. One pamphlet was also issued to inform Filipinos that Japan also had Catholics-- and had a long historical link with the Philippines.

Japan corps nurtured Filipino nationalism by celebrating Filipino holidays. Continued the propaganda line of demonizing the Americans.

Propaganda (of the Japanese)...

- tried to explain their cause
- convinced the Filipinos why siding with the Americans was wrong
- tried to bring Filipinos over to the side of the Japanese through sex (LIKE VISUALLY)
- tried to bring Filipinos over to the side of the Japanese through food (the soldiers on the frontlines were literally starving)
- showed that Japan had Catholics too
- showed that Japan had a long historical link with the Philippines
- tried to convince Filipinos that a new order was at hand, and that the Japanese were responsible for bringing it about
- demonized the Americans
- nurtured Philippine nationalism by celebrating Filipino holidays

## Filipino Propaganda under the Japanese

Part of the politico-cultural policy of Japan in the Philippines was to grant independence, at least on paper

BIPS - Bureau of Information and Public Security (a Japanese propaganda machine)

Laurel Republic - The Japanese-sponsored Republic of the Philippines, with Jose P. Laurel as president

Propaganda (of the Filipinos, in favor of the Japanese)...

- appealed to Filipino nationalism (celebrated Filipino heroes, urged Filipinos to love the native language)
- diminished American influence (see above)
- celebrated the independence of the Philippines under Laurel
- blamed Americans for killing Filipino civilians and destroying churches (American planes dropped bombs)

*Note:* Few Filipinos took the propaganda of both the Japanese and the Filipinos who worked under them seriously (treated the leaflets as trash.)

## Anti-Japanese Propaganda

The Japanese propaganda onslaught in the Philippines was powerful. But reality failed to support the claims of the Japanese propagandists.

Propaganda (of the Filipino guerillas)...

- exposed Japan's propaganda as lies
- exposed the truth of Philippine independence under Japan
- ridiculed Japan's readiness to fight in the Philippines

*Note:* Holding on to guerilla propaganda was extremely risky. The messages and news provided many Filipinos with rays of hope, and despite the threat, the leaflets and newspapers were passed from hand to hand or jealously guarded.

## American Propaganda

PWB - Psychological Warfare Branch (of the Southwest Pacific Command)

The PWB's propaganda effort was directed not only towards the Filipinos but also to the Japanese, Taiwanese, and Koreans.

Propaganda (of the Americans)...

- sabotaged the Japanese propaganda effort

*Note:* The American leaflets contained no verifiable falsehoods to render them ineffective, and thus succeeded in building morale and developing confidence in MacArthur and his forces. To limit their impact, the Japanese banned them.

## Commonwealth Government in Exile

The Philippine Commonwealth government in exile was also active in producing propaganda material.

Propaganda (of the Philippine Commonwealth government in exile)...

- rekindled the Philippines in American memory
- reminded the Americans that Filipinos were still fighting and waiting for the US to return

## Conclusion

The various powers came to realize the value of visual propaganda to get their message across to win the loyalties of the Filipino people and to motivate them to act.

The use of symbols to represent ideals was used by all sides. Demonizing the other size was a common theme.

No matter how poerful or skilled the projection, the message succeeded or failed if the recipient audience was swayed by it. For example, Japanese artists had well thought-out layouts, while Filipino artists had crude, mimeographed sheets. But it was the guerilla images that struck closer to the Filipinos' own experiences with the Japanese.
