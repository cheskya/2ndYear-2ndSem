# Salvador Araneta and the Filipino New Deal

Chapter 2 of "Liberalism and the Postcolony" by Lisandro E. Claudio

This chapter examins how Keynesianism, New Deal liberalism, and economic planning were debated in the PH through the ideas of Salvador Araneta.

Araneta's ideas were widely debated in the 1950s-- a period of economic and political decolonization, a time when the PH was first attempting to formulate industrial policy.

He believed in the expansionary government policy, seeking government credit to finance industry and employment.
