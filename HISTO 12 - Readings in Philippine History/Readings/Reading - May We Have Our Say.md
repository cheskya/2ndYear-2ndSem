Basically, women in the Philippines have much more freedom and influence in their community than their counterparts in other countries.

The Filipino woman...
- is treated as an equal
- retains her maiden name
- shares the honors of her husband
- can dispose freely of the property she had bought
- receives an equal share of parents' property
- can be allowed by custom to rule the state (open to the succession to the headship of the barangay)
- can be entrusted with the religious leadership of their group

It was the Spaniards that unbalanced the unique position of the Filipino woman in society. (damn they brought patriarchy)
- prohibited divorce through religion
- enacted the laws that confined the woman inside the home
- removed from the Filipino woman the right to dispose of her paraphernal property

Filipino men tend to treat Filipino women with consideration (knows she is more fragile, etc.)
