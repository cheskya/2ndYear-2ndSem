## Introduction

Basically, the reading is about how the Revolutionary Congress handled the country's church-state relations.

(Author attempts to examine this episode due to it not being analyzed in Philippine historiography,)

- September 15, 1898
	- Revolutionary Congress convened
	- debate over the relations between the church and state
	- Teodoro Agoncillo and Cesar Majul planned this discussion long ago (1960s) for the Philippine revolution
	- Apolinario Mabini (Aguinaldo's chief adviser) originally planned for this to be an advisory body
- analyses of question of the church-state relations (by Agoncillo and Majul)
	- inadequate
		- not necessarily in terms of historical sources
		- BUT in the interpretive frame with which they explained the divisiveness of this issue
			- Agoncillo says that the congress was full of "triumphant conservatism" despite the church-state separation winning by one vote
			- Majul's work was inconclusive interpretatively
- why separation of church and state?
	- *note:* debate was relatively early when seen from perspective of global history
	- a structural concomitant of (naturally associated with)...
		- spread of rationalization
		- rise of religious pluralism
		- growing dominance of the state in social life
	- how this separation is viewed
		- often seen as a part of a simple linear development, but this view is ahistorical
		- different arrangements around the world suggests that this relation changes and evolves in ways specific to the historical dynamics of particular social formations
	- but...!
		- separation of church and state in the Philippines eventually occurred not because of structural social change but as an imposition by an imperial power

## Overview of Malolos

	- received two versions...
		- from Mabini
		- from Pedro Paterno/

## The Principal Contenders

- Calderon
	- Majul and Agoncillo claim that he is a conservative
	- admittedly, Calderon is close with the Jesuits (got his degree from the Ateneo Municipal)
	- however, Calderon is also antifriar
	- like other ilustrados, regarded Masonry as "more than an anti-Catholic sect, but a society geared to counteract the power of the friars, not so much as ministers of a religion, but as agents of a political power, or rather, as a manifestation of Spanish political colonizing power"
		- friars deemed NOT ministers of religion BUT political agents of the colonial state
- Tomás del Rosario
	- fiercest advocate of separation
	- at the other side of the debate
	- affiliated with Masonry
- about the ilustrados...
	- both sides of the debate shared a common antipathy towards the Spanish friars

---

## Catholicism and the National Movement

Calderon's antifriar sentiment articulated a specific vision of the national community.

- pedro pelaez
	- secularization as matter of right based on law
- jose burgos
	- pursued same issue but turned it into a racial one

- calderon's defense of church-state unity
	- regarded religious freedom as historically absurd and politically inappropriate for the philippines
		- considering that the ones who started the revolutionary movement were priests themselves (pelaez, burgos)
		- native priests were valuable to them
		- was consistent with propaganda movement, who wasn't against the catholic church but the spanish friars

"It is noteworthy that the ilustrados did not promote atheism; rather, they continued to profess faith, if not in God, then at least in Divine Providence."

- however, a focal point of ilustrado nationalism was the exclusion of so-called "primitive" races
	- Filipino - Catholicized and Europeanized native elites
	- not amissilable (not Filipino) - cultural groups represented by Muslims and other highland tribes most of which had not been converted to Catholicism
	- catholicism as the so-called "social glue"?! even when not all Filipinos are catholic?!

## Calderon's Proposal on Church-State Unity

(page 12)

i'm too lazy to read

This provision could be interpreted, even if it was not necessarily Calderón’s intention, as putting the state above the church as in the Patronato Real.

Thus the proposed charter would maintain the status quo except for one funda-

mental difference: Filipinos would staff and control the parishes as well as the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.

## Filipinization: The Native Clergy as Heir to Power

- proponents of church–state unity wanted to push Filipinization not only of the parishes but also of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, deemed as the logical outcome of the struggle for secularization
- calderon had a pragmatic concern...
	- if we go for church-state separation, vatican may be able to name their own priests (and disregard the native clergy)
- Mabini deemed the national church, as the legitimate fruit of the revolution, should be under the direction of the revolutionary government.
	- he want church-state separation but is behind the idea of a national church
	- respects religious pluralism in the Philippines
- Aglipay
	- 
	- sought to mobilize the Filipino clergy to support the revolutionary government

## Debating Church-State Relations

(p.18)

- the girllls are fightinggg
	- Tomás del Rosario explained his opposition to the unity of church and state
	- Manuel Gómez spoke on behalf of the unity of church and state
	- The following day Arcadio del Rosario, with “patent erudition,” took his turn to defend the necessity of religious freedom.
	- Subsequently Calderón, also a polished orator, spoke to elucidate the reasons for his position on church–state unity
	- On November 24 Calderón continued his presentation, but a number of “interruptions” by Tomás del Rosario were recorded
- their arguments
	- Calderon group
	- Rosario group
		- Christianity was the best of all religions, if it had not been altered by human passions (real)

---

## Separationists and the Papacy

- on behalf of separation, Tomás del Rosario argued...
	- profound historical distrust of the Papacy
	- stresses long struggle of the state to free itself from clutches of Rome
		- we can't restrain the Vatican... (references fight of French against Rome)
		- there will be intervention in civil power with disastrous results
	- *Tomás del Rosario’s recounting of European history overdrew the Vatican’s power and underemphasized the French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte. But his point was to suggest that the newly independent Philippines should seize the opportunity brought about by the struggles and wars in Europe that had liberated the state from Roman control. To advocate the contrary was regressive, a return to the Medieval Ages.*
		- note that he mostly used European history to explain this
		- he left out Philippine history, not because he doesn't know it, but because of the importance of the members of the native clergy and their relation to them
	- keeping unity will just make us repeat our mistakes again

not common to have separation of church and state (except in America and UK)

- colonies of Spain (like america) saw separation of church and state, except philippines ig... :0

## The Catholic Clergy and the Deferment of Separation

members of the Filipino clergy attended the sessions of the revolutionary congress, eagerly participating "as spectators and lobbyists"

after triumph of separation, a number of Filipino priests petitioned Aguinaldo to preserve the Catholic Church's position and veto the Congress's decision

- religion (as source of morality) was the basis of society and government
- Catholicism was the religion of the majority
- separation was one of the errors of liberalism and condemned by the popes
- religious liberty meant that people could think of God in whatever way they wanted, giving rise to error and impiety
- triumph of the revolution was God's handiwork (people had to be grateful and demonstrate this gratitude by safeguarding the Catholic Church as the state religion and prohibiting other religions)

Aglipay

- lone Catholic priest who was a member of the Revolutionary Congress
- tried to have the amendment suspended
- was instrumental in persuading Mabini to do that

*biggest reason:* pope can be the only one who appoints native priests (cannot be secularized properly if there's a separation between the church and the state)

he only saw filipinos as those who were europeanized and catholicized

Church would serve as a unifying force for Filipinos (everyone except the non-Catholics ig........)

## Conclusion: Conflicting Visions of National Community

 In other words, their imagined community was simultaneously nationalist and Catholic, a tricky conflation of two types of imagined communities that operated on the basis of diametrically opposed time and space coordinates.

This unity would drive away non-Catholics in Philippine society though.

## Epilogue: The Imposition of Separation

the question remained unresolved

for the sake of political expediency the Malolos Republic maintained the unity of church and state

however, the US colonial policy on church-state separation resolved the question instead
