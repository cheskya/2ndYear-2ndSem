- two works provided different view
	- richardson's book
	- guerrero's dissertation
- what view?
	- the katipunan class composition was anything but plebian
		- made up of members of middle class
		- there were only two "laborers"
	- the katipunan was liberal in orientation
		- ...coming out of Rizal's short-lived Liga Filipina
		- had a lot in common with ilustrados
		- no links with millenarian colorum sects
			- but they'd come to appropriate aspects of katipunan later on
			- articulated in french enlightenment, etc rather than rituatls of church and other folk epic like the pasyon
	- never had a goal beyond uniting the philippine colony for the sake of overthrowing spain
		- sought the formation of a body that would become a new sovereign nation
	- goal of unity meant side stepping, if not surpressing, differences
		- they rarely mention social categories
		- the avoidance of difference was startegic
		- aimed primarily at regime change, not social change
		- the katipunan never planned to redistribute land or to democratize social relations
	- deep factional divisions tore through the katipunan ranks
		- there was conflict over control of the revolution
	- inter-class conflicts arguably didn't emerge until much later (with the return of aguinaldo from exile and the reformation of the republic in malolos)
		- republic trying to impose taxes
		- republic, after initially ending forced labor, tried to restore it again to draft men into militias
			- ended in economic disaster since no more able-bodied men to tend fields
		- republic also sought to secure support of provincial elites by promising them friar lands
			- resulted in land-grabbing
		- congress mortaged the assets of the country to wealthy ilustrados in exchange for loans to finance the fight
		- congress was unable/unwilling to curb on-going abuses of its military forces
	- peasant armies emerged to fight the republic
		- class warfare of sorts erupted in many parts of Luzon
	- there was no break between the Katipunan and the Malolos Republic
		- no shift from a revolutionary to a counter-revolutionary moment
		- nation to be ruled by wealthiest and most earned people
