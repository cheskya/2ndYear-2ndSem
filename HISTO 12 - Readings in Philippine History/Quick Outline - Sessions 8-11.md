## Session 9
Buwisan System
- hacienderos lease lands to peasants
- peasants pay rent in full

Kasama System (Crop Sharing)
- hacienderos lease land to inquilinos
- inquilinos lease land to peasants (kasamas)
- peasants pay thru combination of montly rent and crop sharing with inquilinos and hacienderos
NOT FAIR!
- rich inquilinos graduated into hacienderos
- kasamas stayed like that forever
- but they (kasamas) accepted it because of reciprocity (kasamas get protection, other two get loyalty)
IS OPPRESSIVE!
- same farmers that participated in the revolution
- they (kasamas/tenant-farmers) do not leave because while they are oppressed, they do not feel oppressed

Capitalism
- loss of reciprocity
- exploitations by hacienderos
- adoption of more capitalistic policies
- all of this made the farmers realize their oppression
- peasant unrest
	- Sakdal party
		- peasant unions collobrate with political parties
		- platform is true and immediate independence
			- true - return to ideals of katipunan
			- immediate - no compromises and transition period
		- eventually there was a Sakdal Uprising
		- would disband and reorganize as the Ganap Party
		- members were also members of the Makapili (JP collaborators)
	- other peasant unions
	- Isabelo Delos Reyes
- peasant unions in WW2 would form the Hukabalahap
	- peasants either become Japanese collaborators (Makapili) or against the Japanese (labor unions)
