## Second Philippine Commission

This was called the Taft Commission, led by William Howard Taft.

Americanistas

- Goal – to make the Philippines a part of the US 
- People
	- Trinidad Pardo de Tavera – most-well known
	- The first Resident Commissioners 
		- Benito Legarda 
		- Pablo Ocampo 
	- Gregorio Araneta
	- Pedro “Papa P” Paterno 
	- Felipe Buencamino
- Why did they align with this ideology?
	- many members of the Americanistas were also Ilustrados and Propagandistas (so same views)
	- So it was better for them to become a region of America than to clamor for independence for the sake of representation in government
	- to protect economic interests (more practical than waging war)
- Formed the Partido Federal

Partido Federal

- Platform – statehood (for the Philippines to be a part of the United States)
- Needed to be close to Taft to gain political position, so this movement was powerful from 1902-1907, consider also that positions in the Upper Court were appointed, there was also no elections until 1907 

Partido Nacionalista

- emerged from the merger of small local political parties
- Main platform – Nationhood 
- Demand for complete and immediate independence

By the time the election would roll around, even propertied man wanted independence – the PF was at a disadvantage, not popular enough to win seats in the Philippine Assembly.

So the PF would rebrand to the Partido Progresista – the idea for progress for the Filipinos if and only if they were a part of America.

From 1907-1912, the PN would win because the desire for voting Filipinos at the time was independence. Furthermore, the PN would also have connections on the ground from being comprised of smaller local political parties – patronage networks, on which the PN had a great advantage against the PP.

### Jones Law of 1916

(The Philippines Independence bill would be passed in both the PH and US.)

The promise of relinquishing of sovereignty from the US to the PH AS SOON AS a stable government can be established.

- US was still very vague about when to let PH be independent
	- "when it's independent enough for us" what does that mean??
- reorganization of the philippine (insular) government
	- divisions (new changes)
		- executive
			- governor-general - william howard taft
			- vice governor
			- cabinet
			- internal auditor
		- legislative (bicameral, and both are now elected. both leaders were also from the nacionalista part, and encountered rivalry)
			- ph senate
				- senate president
					- first one was Manuel L. Quezon
			- house or representatives
				- speaker of the house
					- first one of Sergio Osmena Sr.
		- judiciary
			- supreme court
			- courts of first instance

Leaving the Filipinos with no other platform than Independence – but what would happen after independence was not clear. So...

During elections, people would vote not based on platforms, but on personality.

- First Senate President – Manuel L. Quezon
	- Colectivistas – party should make decisions based on collective vote 
- First Speaker of the House – Sergio Osmena Sr. 
	- Unipersonalistas – decisions made by the party should only be dictated by one man 

The PN would collapse, and the Partido Democrata would be established. (but still, no clear goals...)
