Resources:
- Recorded Lecture for Session 17
- This is all Archur's notes (tysm tysm tysm)

---

- Focuses on the youth from the 1960's (the boomers)
- The effects on Philippine society at the time by these movements

### **Ecumenism**
- Promoting unity among the world's Christian Churches
	- Second Vatican Council (Vatican II)
	- World Council of Churches
- The goal was not only to evangelize and spread the word of God, but also to spread the word of social injustices

**Liberation Theology**
- Emerged first in South America
- Preferential treatment of the poor
	- Churches becoming a Church for the poor
- Signalled that Marxist theories aren't the opposite of Christianity
	- Religion as an "opium of the masses"
		- Mechanism to hide existing social contradictions
- Also known as the "Theology of Struggle" in the Philippines
- Led to the creation of different Church groups in the Philippines
	- Protestant
		- National Council of Churches in the Philippines (NCCP)
		- United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP)
	- Catholic
		- Christians for National Liberation (CNL)

### **Muslim Independence Movement**
- A secessionist organization aimed at ending Filipino internal colonialism in Mindanao by establishing an independent Muslim nation-state that will encompass the whole island
	- Later changed its name to Mindanao Independence Movement to assure Christians in Mindanao that they will not be treated as second class citizens
- After the end of the American colonization, there's a new colonial power in Mindanao—Filipinos
	- Since Muslims have a different set of culture and traditions from Filipinos, they do not envision themselves in the same imagined community, but instead as colonizers
- Was not radical at first, however due to Magsaysay's Agrarian Reform Program that relocated farmers from Central Luzon to Mindanao, conflicts arose from the different parties
	- This led to trouble and eventually bloodshed

**Root cause** — compared to the Spanish colonization period, there is a transition in the politics of the Moros in the American colonization period
- Spanish colonization: Interaction with Spanish Manila is very limited
	- The Sultanates were more regional than national
		- They engaged more with SEA neighbours than the Christians in Manila
- American colonization: America tried to reincorporate Mindanao within the Philippine National State
	- Muslims leaders such as Datu Piang, who were regional leaders, had to reorient themselves and their politics to national politics in Manila
		- The effect can be seen when Hadji Butu, a relative of Datu Piang, no longer sees himself—nor Moros see themselves—in regional terms, but in national terms
	- Americas see and treat non-Hispanized Filipinos differently to Hispanized Filipinos
		- Important to note that Mindanao was also under military rule, further reinforcing this idea
		- Important to note that the Muslims weren't fully unified, there were rivalries among ethnic groups
		- This created tension
- Datu Udtug Matalam — leader
- The Jabidah Massacre heavily radicalized the Mindanao Independence Movement, and became the foundation of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)

### **Counterculture Movement**
- An anti-establishment movement that developed in the 1960s
- Baby boomers (those born in the aftermath of World War II) challenged the pre-existing norms and beliefs of the parents
- It created different subcultures that challenged the rising tide of authoritarianism around the world
- Main reason for the rise of the movements: increased education opportunities after the war

**Embodiments of the Counterculture Movement**
- Japan's Kawaii Culture to counter Japan's very "masculine" view of itself
- Music (The Beatles, Elvis Presley, The Monkees) — some of their songs represent youth rebellion
- Sexual Revolution — a movement that challenged the traditional codes of behaviour related to sexuality, interpersonal relationships, and gender identity
	- Sex from being seen as a private and shameful thing, to something public and normal

**Kabataang Makabayan** — the more political aspect of the counterculture movement
- Because of the increased education opportunities after the war, students who gained knowledge of the social injustices formed student unions, then eventually formed the Kabataang Makabayan
	- Famous example would be the First Quarter Storm during the Marcos regime
	- Diliman Commune

**Intelligentsia**
- **Radical Academics** — only way to solve the contradictions in Philippine society is to revolt against the state
	- Nur Misuari — created the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF)
	- Jose Maria Sison — created the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP)
- **Technocrats** — they believe that the problems of Philippine society at the time was elite democracy
	- Not through revolt, but "leading" the elites into the proper path to Philippine development
	- Cesar Virata — Lead technocrat under the Marcos dictatorship
- **Civil Society** — students who became well aware of Philippine society at the time became more engaged politically
	- The largest group
	- Slowly reform Philippine society through the use of advocacy politics
	- It was in its infancy in the 1960's
		- Unlike the civil society we saw in other countries, it was weakened by the declaration of Martial Law, because when Marcos declared Martial Law, many members of the society decided to immigrate to other countries
- These groups showcased the state of the Philippines back then—a state of unrest
	- Politicians decided to solve things peacefully—by **changing the 1935 Constitution**
	- This led to the **Constitutional Convention** in 1970 and 1971
