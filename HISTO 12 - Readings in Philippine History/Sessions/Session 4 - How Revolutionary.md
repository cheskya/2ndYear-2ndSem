Typically, the Bonifacio and Aguinaldo conflict is seen as a class conflict – because Bonifacio is (incorrectly) interpreted as plebeian.

Rather, it was a conflict of Urban and Rural middle classes. (Horizontal instead of Vertical conflict, Intraclass instead of Interclass.)

## Two Phases of the Revolution

(as said by Teodoro Agoncillo)

- 1896-1897
	- led by the masses
	- represented by Bonifacio
	- After the Tejeros Convention, the elites captured the revolution and exiled its original leaders 
- 1897-1898 (+1902)
	- led by the elites
	- the elites would betray the revolution by signing with the Americans

This is the typical narrative, but from the readings that is not the case

### Goals of the Revolution

- **political goal** - kasarinlan (initial goal)
	- external and internal sovereign
	- filipino control of natural resources
	- recognition of statehood and nationhood from other sovereign nation-states
- **social goal** - kalayaan (final goal)
	- kapatiran or brotherhood of all filipinos
		- may utang na loob sa mga magulang (similar to relationship of filipinos to their mother land / inang bayan)
	- kaguinhawaan or the proper distribution of resources among the populace
		- government will play a major role in this
	- kaliwanagan ng loob or enlightenment
		- respect for the dignity of each other and the willingness to help each other times of need
- *note:* kasarinlan will lead to kalayaan
	- in this context, the revolution of the philippines is indeed revolutionary
	- BUT it is a revolution that must not finish (and is still ongoing)

## ...The Actual Revolution

(If we were to read Jim Richardson and Mia Guerrero's readings...)

Because of reform, the urban middle class were able to move up the social ladder but only to some extent – had a ceiling because of Indio status.

So, the actual goal in the revolution is to erase this ceiling, create a floor to prevent the Principales from losing their power.

Rural elites were moving down the social ladder because of the arrival of more Spaniards in the early 19th century, so their goal was to maintain local political influence.

So, in other words, the rural and urban middle classes had different interests.
- Aguinaldo already had local power
- Bonifacio was moving up the social ladder

## Pact of Biak-na-Bato

This was led by Aguinaldo and Paterno.

The compromise in Biak-na-Bato focused on ending the revolution and addressing the
concerns of the revolutionaries. The goal was to rebuild the trust between the Spaniards and
Filipinos. The Pact of Biak-na-Bato had four major provisions:

- Implementation of reforms and reduction of taxes and ending the polo y servicio.
	- The Spanish colonial government agreed to implement reforms to address some of Aguinaldo's demands. The Spaniards promised to increase the government offices available to Filipinos, reduce the amount of tributo (tribute) demanded from the populace, and end the policy of polo y Servicio (forced labor). Key issues such as freedom of the press and secularization of the parishes still needed to be addressed.

- Revolutionary leaders will be exiled in Hong Kong. The nephew of the Governor-General will join the revolutionaries.
	- Aguinaldo and key members of the revolutionary government were sent to exile in the British colony of Hong Kong. Miguel Primo de Rivera, Fernando’s nephew, will accompany the revolutionaries in Hong Kong as a hostage until the Spaniards paid reparations and implemented reforms.

- Revolutionary leaders will receive a total of 800,000 Mexican Dollars to be paid in three installments.
	- As reparation for the exiled revolutionaries, the Spanish colonial government promised to pay Aguinaldo and his group 800,000 Mexican dollars. The reparation payment will be paid in three installments. $MXN400,000 will be given to Aguinaldo upon his departure from Biak-na-Bato. $MXN200,000 will be paid when the arms surrendered by the revolutionists amounted to 800 pieces. The last installment worth $MXN200,000 will be given when the arms surrendered amounted to 1,000 pieces and the Te Deum was played in the Cathedral in Manila as thanksgiving for the restoration of peace.

- Amnesty for all revolutionaries. A total of 900,000 Mexican Dollars (later reduced to 800,000) will be distributed to the revolutionaries that remain in the Philippines
	- A general amnesty will be declared after the remaining rebels surrendered their weapons to the Spanish colonial government. Spain will also pay a total sum of $MXN900,000 to be divided equally to all revolutionaries that remained in the Philippines as compensation for the hardships and violence experienced by the rebels during the war.

Following the provisions in the pact, Aguinaldo, Miguel Primo de Rivera, and twenty-five top officials of the Philippine revolutionary government left the Philippines for Hong Kong on December 23, 1897. At the same time, the colonial government began confiscation of weapons owned by revolutionaries. Confident that peace had been restored, Fernando Primo de Rivera declared the end of the Revolution and the continuation of Spanish suzerainty in the Philippines. Little did he know that the Revolution was just entering its second phase.

While the pact did foster a temporary truce, Spanish and Filipino forces occasionally
clashed on the ground. (Most buried their weapons rather than surrender them. Likewise, the colonial government still didn't trust the revolutionaries.)

## Hong Kong Junta

A grouped formed by Aguinaldo's revolutionaries and the Filipinos exiled by the Spaniards after the 1872 Cavite Mutiny.

They planned to use the Spanish reparation payments to purchase arms and ammunition from Japan and prepare for another revolution in case the Spaniards failed to implement its promised reforms. 

To prevent this from happening, the Spanish government halted all payments to Aguinaldo and the Filipino exiles until the Katipunans that refused to surrender voluntarily dissolved. As a response, the agitated Junta repudiated the Pact of Biak-na-Bato.

While all of this happened, Spain was at war with the US.

## Spanish-American War

Upon returning to the Philippines, Aguinaldo received offers from the Spaniards to form a
Spanish-Filipino alliance to resist the US invasion of the Philippines.

- The Spaniards promised...
	- To implement socio-economic reforms in the Philippines
	- To give the Filipinos greater participation in the government
	- To recognize Aguinaldo’s status as a general and military leader

- The Americans promised...
	- To bring Aguinaldo back to the Philippines.
	- To help arm the revolutionaries
	- To provide some recognition to Aguinaldo’s government.
	- *All of their promises were not put into writing* 

The unkept Spanish promises in Biak-na-Bato left a lasting impression on Filipino Revolutionaries. 

Aguinaldo chose the American offer.

## Second Phase of the Revolution

![[philippine-revolution-second-phase.png]]

Because not all of the Philippines were in the hands of the revolutionaries, independence would be declared in Kawit, Cavite on June 12, 1898

But why declare independence now?

- Main audience of the Declaration – foreign countries, Filipinos trying to convince other countries to recognize her as independent because of backing from the US 
- So not in Manila, but in Cavite 

The Philippine Revolution, which had a proletariat orientation was betrayed when the Ilustrados took over the Malolos Republic.

(Agoncillo’s analysis, however, conflates Ilustrado status for elite social class)

- Mabini was of the lower class but considered Ilustrado
