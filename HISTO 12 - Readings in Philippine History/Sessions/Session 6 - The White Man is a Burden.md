The "White Man’s Burden" is a poem written in the American perspective to justify the colonization of the Philippines

## Myths

- white love
	- paternalistic form of love
	- subjugation of other cultures not as racism or prejudice
	- Not hating the people they conquered, but loving them so much they wanted to bring them civilization
	- That they did not want to occupy the Philippines but had no choice but to do so – an image of a older family figure taking care of the Philippines 

- manifest destiny
	- the USA was “destined” to expand territory and spread freedom 
	- mage of the destiny of America to advance and expand territory
	- they believed it was their destiny to expand territory to bring freedom, democracy, and American ideals to other peoples
	- Irony – teaching others about freedom by depriving them of it, by colonizing and conquering them

## Thoughts of the Public

The American public was against the intervention and occupation of the archipelago as it was mirroring what the Europeans were doing.

> "Our little brown brothers… would need fifty to one hundred years of close supervision… to develop anything resembling Anglo-Saxon principles and skills."

William Howard Taft saw the Americans taking the position of an elderly brother who will help the Philippines.

Another popular American military song would prove that other Americans did not agree with Taft's view ("he ain't a brother of mine")

## Benevolent Assimilation

led by President William McKinley

- Claimed that the role was to help the Philippines create their own nation – not a case of conquering and plundering, but rather benevolent assimilation 
- Not as an enemy of the Filipinos, but a friend that will help them end 300 years of Spanish colonization
- That the US is not like the other colonizers, that they will help the Philippines

But the Americans would betray the Philippines multiple times, the statement was to win over the American public in the pursuit of colonization.

## Propaganda

Dean Worcester was sent to the Philippines as part of the Schurman commission – commission to provide ideas to the American government.

Took pictures of Bontoc Igorot Warriors becoming "more civilized" by becoming part of the Philippine Constabulary (military police)

In reality, these photographs were fake.

## Tensions between Americans and Filipinos

The Americans would occupy Manila by the end of the Spanish-American war while most revolutionaries had occupied most of Luzon. This would lead to tensions and escalate to a full-scale war.

February 4, 1899
- Filipino side – American soldiers shooting Filipino soldiers in the bridge
- American side – claiming self-defense, not calling it a war lest they recognize the First Philippine Republic and the independence of the Philippines
	- Called it the Philippine Insurgency instead – by calling them insurgents, the Americans claim control over the archipelago
- For the Philippines, it was a war against American aggression and that they had already established a government 
	- Called it the Philippine-American War

## Goals of the Filipinos during the War

(Antonio Luna)

- Make the war as unpopular to the American public
- Prolong the war as long as possible. Make sure that the Americans suffer high casualty count.
- Prolong the war as long as possible. Make sure that the Americans suffer high casualty count.
- Prolong the war as long as possible. Make sure that the Americans suffer high casualty count.

## What Happens Next

One fundamental weakness of the Philippine Forced Army is their loyalty to either Aguinaldo or their commander rather than to the Republic.

They tried attacking in multiple directions to encircle the Americans, but failed because of the lack of loyalty.

The Americans would commit atrocities against the Filipinos and use propaganda against them.

- The image of the Filipino as primitive
- Arguing that the Philippines is not a nation because it is divided into different “tribes” and thus should be managed differently – that the Americans came to “teach them how to establish a nation” 
- Use of the term “savage” to describe the Filipinos

## Downfall

McKinley would go on to win the election.

The Malolos Republic would suffer from division.

Luna was not popular at the time and would have conflicts with the soldiers, leading to them refusing his orders. Luna would eventually be assassinated, which would be a huge blow to the republic because he was the only general in the Republic Army at the time with the military capabilities to actually implement strategies that could protect the republic.

There would be quick transitions of members in the cabinet.

- Aguinaldo would be replaced by Paterno, a well-known Americanista
- This, alongside the assassination of Luna, would further weaken the Republic’s capabilities of resisting American rule
- Forced to move northward in order to escape the Americans

Eventually, Aguinaldo would be arrested in Pananan, Isabela, on March 23, 1901, signaling the end of the Philippine-American War, the end of the first Philippine Republic, and the end of resistance to American colonialism.

Some resistance would continue until 1912. But Aguinaldo's surrender specifically signals the end of elite resistance.
