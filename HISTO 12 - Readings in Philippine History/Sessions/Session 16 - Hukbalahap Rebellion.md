## Hukbong Magpapalaya sa Bayan

- AKA "People's Liberation Army" or "HMB"
- this is what the HUKBALAHAP would be renamed to after some time (the old one stood for "Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon")
- some notable leaders, none of which were peasants but lawyers for peasant's rights
- some female commanders

Faustino Del Mundo (AKA Kumander Sumulong) - remnant of HMB

## Democratic Alliance

The peasants would gain military experience during the war. Specifically, they could fight back against landlord suppression, which was seen as a threat. (Several commanders would be murdered as a result.)

Because of this, they needed to form an alliance with the existing government.

They allied with...
- Nacionalista Party (with Osmena)
- PKP (Communist Party of the Philippines, with Jesus Lava)
- HMB

- The Huks would continue their rebellion, with funding from the Soviet union (PKP was friendly with that country)
- Magsaysay was considered the "man of the masses," and this branding would be used a lot. He would be painted as kind.

"We showed them (the landlords and government) we weren't slaves. We didn't lie down like whimpering dogs when they started to whip us. We stood up and fought for what is rightfully ours... No strike, no demonstration, no rebellion fails. Protest against injustice always succeeds."
