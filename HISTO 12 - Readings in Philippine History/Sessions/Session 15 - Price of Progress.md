## Third Republic

- 1946-1972
- On July 4, 1946, the US granted the PH its independence.
- Manuel Roxas became the first president of the Republic.
	- Would then have six presidents... (RQMGMM)
		- Roxas (Liberal)
		- Quirino (Liberal)
		- Magsaysay (Nacionalista)
		- Garcia (Nacionalista)
		- Macapagal (Liberal)
		- Marcos (Nacionalista)
	- Because of weak political parties, their stances would often fluctuate.
	- Majority wins, because only the two parties were of relevance.
- PH politics centered on plans over parties

### Concerns of the Third Republic

- Economic
	- Engagement in global market w/o help of US
	- Trade relations bet the PH and the US
	- Negotiating for reparation payments from the US and JP (amends)
	- Industrialization

*Note:*

The exchange rate affects the market and trade relations. (if php is weak and us dollars is strong, exported ph products are cheap, so export ph products. else, make products for the local market.)

*Fiscal Policy* - how you raise revenue, how gov collects money, and how gov spends money (about revenue and expenditures) (handled by business of finance, finance secretary)

*Monetary Policy* - the amount of money that is circulating within the economy (handled by central bank)

- Security
	- Internal
		- Peasant unrest
		- Mindanao Independence Movement
	- External
		- Shift of Cold War to Asia
		- Diplomatic Clash with Neighbors (e.g. Korea and Vietnam wars)
		- Creating a stronger PH state

### Solutions of the Third Republic

- Economic
	- Philippine Trade Act (1946)
		- Preferential tariffs on US products
		- The US controls dollar-peso exchange rate, fixed at 1 USD = 2 PHP
			- Influences how much goods are exported to and imported from PH and US
			- The US can decide whether or not PH goods will be competitive internationally
		- Parity rights given to American Citizens
		- Raising sugar quota exports to the US
		- Was passed because the US threatened not to give reparation payments otherwise
	- Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1955
		- US loses control over the peso-dollar exchange rate

- Security
	- Military Bases Agreement
		- The US will continue to use our bases in the PH
		- If US soldier commits a crime within or near base, they cannot be tried on PH soil
		- Question of PH sovereignity
	- Mutual Defense Treaty
		- If US territory is attacked by an external force, the PH will consider it an attack on their territory and vice versa
		- Makes it hard for PH to have independent foreign affairs

## Industrialization

An economy usually goes through this process:

1. Agricultural
2. Industrial
3. Service

The transition from an agricultural to industrial economy is called "industrialization."

### Salvador Araneta vs Miguel Cuaderno

- Cuaderno
	- proposal is to import substitution
		- everything you import to the philipppines, you try to do at home
		- model is Argentina
		- gov doesn't need to pay much (fiscal) but peso should be high to encourage the local market (monetary)
	- wanted the gov to make the peso strong

- Araneta
	- proposal is export-oriented industrialization
		- produce goods not for filipino consumption but for international consumption
		- model is Japan
		- gov must pay more esp for infrastructure (fiscal) and peso should be low to sell the products to other countries (monetary)
	- PH would have to borrow more money
	- PH products would be more competitive
	- reactions
		- unpopular to the masses
		- PH would embrace export orientation during the Martial Law, but it would be too late because the price of oil would skyrocket due to wars in the Middle East

- Carlos P. Garcia
	- would side with Cuaderno
	- being a part of old political cliques, was more inclined towards import substitution, esp since Argentina at the time was successful
		- but this was from the time that countries were not as interconnected
		- was also not involved in WWII

## Instabilities

- Roxas would die of a heart attack and be replaced by Quirino
- Magsaysay would die due to a plain crash
- Corruption and political issues
- Stonehill scandal (politicians receiving bribes from Harry Stonehill)
- Balance of payment crisis
