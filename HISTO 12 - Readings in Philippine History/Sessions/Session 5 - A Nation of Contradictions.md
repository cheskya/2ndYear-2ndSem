# A Nation of Contradictions

## Malolos Convention

- the revolutionaries chose Malolos to convene in
	- Manila was invaded by Spanish
	- they wanted a capital close to Manila and that they could defend

## Contradiction A

What will be aguinaldo's role as president?

- should he be a dictator (strong executive)?
	- mabini wanted this
		- strong legislature will lead to an oligarchy
		- the american question (if we go to war with the american's, we need quick and decisive actions) (argues that dictatorship will only be temporary)
		- the role of ilustrados in aguinaldo's cabinet
- should he be a mere figurehead (strong legislature)?
	- calderon wanted this
		- strong executive is against liberalism
		- military loyalty (not loyal to the state, only to aguinaldo)
		- aguinaldo's experience in national governance and foreign affairs

*Note (the three branches of the government):*

- **legislature** - creates laws
	- president of the assembly - pedro paterno (imposter...)
	- *note:* back then, the house was unicameral (now it's bicameral, containing the house of representatives and the Senate)
- **executive** - executes or implements laws
	- president of the republic - emilio aguinaldo
	- vice president - mariano trias
	- cabinet officials
- **judiciary** - interprets the law
	- chief justice - apolinario mabini (did not take office)
	- solicitor-general of the republic (lawyer of the government) (now this role is under the executive branch)
- how it works...
	- national assembly elects the president
	- president can veto laws
	- national assembly appoints the chief justice and solictor-general
	- supreme court can nullify passed bills
	- supreme court can declare policies unconstitutional
	- president confirms chief justice and solicitor-general
	- permanent commission may declare members of the executive and judiciary branch unfit for service and remove them from office (no impeachment back then)
	- SO BASICALLY?
		- legislative branch was still made very strong even though aguinaldo was a dictator (executive and judiciary couldn't check legislative members)

*Note (head of government vs state):*

- **head of government** - executes policies
- **head of state** - a figure for the people (speeches, etc.)

## Contradiction B

What will be the relationship of the church and the state under the republic?

- should there be a union or separation of church and state?
	- a separation
		- mabini wanted this
			- liberal errr BLAH
		- what happens?
			- there is no state religion (does not sponsor a religion)
			- cannot use government funds to build religious structures
			- cannot tax churches
			- churches can still criticize government
			- priests cannot run for government (need to not be a priest first)

## Contradiction C

Who will control the armed forces? The national or local government?

- Local 
	- Traditional role of the Principalia
	- Ability to control the populace
	- “Imperialist” Manila
- National
	- Warlordism and regionalism 
	- Military loyalty
	- American threat

(I feel like they went with the national government considering Philippine history but IDK. Forgot what sir said.)

## Contradiction D

How should the republic address the potential threat posed by the US?

- Attack
	- Americans are untrustworthy
	- There are few American soldiers in the Philippines
	- The US will eventually send reinforcements
- Negotiate
	- Threats from other colonial powers
	- So the US would be a potential ally
	- Foreign recognition

Spain would sell the Philippines to the US in the Treaty of Paris, so this wouldn't matter anyway.

(Filipino-American war broke out.)

## Another Conflict

How will the government fund itself?

Taxed the people (even when they promised that there would be no more taxing like what the Spanish government did if the Filipinos took over)

The more property you have, the more you pay. Soldiers and men in active services, those over 60 years old of age, the physically and mentally handicapped were FREE.

(This encouraged people to become soldiers, even elites with property. Although elites didn't have to do much even as soldiers since they were priviledged enough to avoid risky situations.)
