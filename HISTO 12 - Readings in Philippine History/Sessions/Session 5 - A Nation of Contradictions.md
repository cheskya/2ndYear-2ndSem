## Malolos Convention

- the revolutionaries chose Malolos to convene in
	- Manila was invaded by Spanish
	- they wanted a capital close to Manila and that they could defend

## Contradiction A

What will be aguinaldo's role as president?

- should he be a dictator (strong executive)?
	- mabini wanted this
		- strong legislature will lead to an oligarchy
		- the american question (if we go to war with the american's, we need quick and decisive actions) (argues that dictatorship will only be temporary)
		- the role of ilustrados in aguinaldo's cabinet
- should he be a mere figurehead (strong legislature)?
	- calderon wanted this
		- strong executive is against liberalism
		- military loyalty (not loyal to the state, only to aguinaldo)
		- aguinaldo's experience in national governance and foreign affairs

*Note (the three branches of the government):*

- **legislature** - creates laws
	- president of the assembly - pedro paterno (imposter...)
	- *note:* back then, the house was unicameral (now it's bicameral, containing the house of representatives and the Senate)
- **executive** - executes or implements laws
	- president of the republic - emilio aguinaldo
	- vice president - mariano trias
	- cabinet officials
- **judiciary** - interprets the law
	- chief justice - apolinario mabini (did not take office)
	- solicitor-general of the republic (lawyer of the government) (now this role is under the executive branch)
- how it works...
	- national assembly elects the president
	- president can veto laws
	- national assembly appoints the chief justice and solictor-general
	- supreme court can nullify passed bills
	- supreme court can declare policies unconstitutional
	- president confirms chief justice and solicitor-general
	- permanent commission may declare members of the executive and judiciary branch unfit for service and remove them from office (no impeachment back then)
	- SO BASICALLY?
		- legislative branch was still made very strong even though aguinaldo was a dictator (executive and judiciary couldn't check legislative members)

*Note (head of government vs state):*

- **head of government** - executes policies
- **head of state** - a figure for the people (speeches, etc.)

## Contradiction B

What will be the relationship of the church and the state under the republic?

- should there be a union or separation of church and state?
	- a separation
		- mabini wanted this
			- liberal errr BLAH
		- what happens?
			- there is no state religion (does not sponsor a religion)
			- cannot use government funds to build religious structures
			- cannot tax churches
			- churches can still criticize government
			- priests cannot run for government (need to not be a priest first)
