## Before the Propaganda Movement

Changes that happened in Spain:

- Latin American Wars for Independence
	- Spain lost most of its colonies in America including Mexico
	- Eventually led to the different revolutions of former Spanish colonies in America
	- Remaining colonies – Philippines, Cuba
		- Need to be more profitable to compensate for the losses in revolutionary wars – economic and political reform in particular

- Instability of Bourbon Rule
	- King of Spain, Alfonso not having a successor after death
	- Either his daughter (Isabela) or brother (Carlos) – resulted in Civil War (Carlist Wars)

- Carlist Wars
	- Conservatives – allied with Carlos
	- Liberals – allied with Isabela  
	- Isabela was initially receptive of the Liberals but veered towards the conservatives as well once she ruled – conflict bet. Liberals and Conservatives resulted in reforms that also affected the Philippines
		- Competition bet. Liberals and Conservatives in Spanish Politics – when one is in power, reforms leaning towards their ideologies are implemented, same for the other
		- This affected what kind of reforms were implemented in the Philippines
	- Carlos Maria de la Torres – introduced many liberal reforms that empowered the Insulares and the Creoles in the Philippines  
		- Insulares, Mestizos, Creoles – held important economic and political positions

## Reforms

- opening of Manila to world trade
	- anyone who wanted to trade in the port of manila was allowed to trade
	- Mid-19th Century – opening of Suez Canal to Egypt, travel from Europe to Asia was cut in half, easier for goods and ideas to arrive from Europe to the Philippines 
		- made Manila a hotbed for ideas and concepts from Europe, mainly nationalism and liberalism (European politics spread in the PH)

- create new infrastructures and institutions
	- to support economic growth
	- e.g. Ferrocarril Manila, the precursor of modern philippine national railway
		- From Manila-Dagupan, Pangasinan 
		- Became operational in the 19th century

- urbanization and opening of new businesses
	- hotel de oriente - first five star hotel in the philippines
	- Manila became more and more urbanized, more commercial establishments
	- rise of cosmopolitan in the manila was affected by the urbanization

- reforms in key institutions like education and public health
	- productive colony = productive population -> need to give education and public health
	- introduced reforms for education and public health
	- spaniards was the one who introduced education and public health in 19th century
	- Schools at this time include Ateneo Municipal, UST, and Colegio San Juan de Letrán
		- ateneo municpal - one of the three first class schools (like santo tomas and leteran) (ust first and only westernized first class tertiary in the philippines and the far east or asia back then) (ateneo and leteran was first class westernized tertiary)

- emergence of a new highly educated and urban middle-class
	- Liberalism and Nationalism made its way into the Philippines
	- ilustrados would emerge from this
	- these reforms also resulted in multiple issues in philippine society
		- secularization issues

---

## Secularization

The reforms would later introduce issues into the Philippines.

Secularization - transfer of leadership and management of the parishes from the regular priests (friars) to the secular clergy

There were two kinds of priests back then!

- regular priest (friars)
	- convert non-christians to christianity
	- member of a friar order (FDJRA)
		- fransiscans
		- dominicians
		- jesuits
		- recollects
		- agustinians
	- main task is to go to different parts of the philippines to convert

- secular priests
	- who will remain in the communities that were converted to provide sacraments
	- not a member of a friar order
		- the only way to become this is if you are a spaniard
		- all indio priests are secular priests (impossible)
			- they got angry
			- this is a crucial part of philippine politics. filipinos are the one who is in charge of the politics of the philippines
			- principales in government (allowing filipinos to control the municipalities) (opens up chance for rebellion) (but they are controlled by the parish priests) (it is very important for colonial government to assure that parish priest is loyal to the government) (so it's better if the priest is spanish than filipino)
			- archbishop commanded that it's okay, but they refused because it is the only way to control the principales
			- became a bigger issue because many secular priests began demanding them to follow the order of the archbishop (secularization movement)

Thus the secularization movement happened...!

- 1774 – Archbishop Basilio Santa Justa orders the secularization of the parishes
	- Friar orders resist because of their important political role in colonial governance
	- Succeeding Governor-Generals often side with the Friars regarding the secularization issue 
	- Happened when most of Filipinos had already converted

This became an issue in the 19th century – many secular priests, many of whom were educated, pushed for the implementation of Secularization.

- pedro pelaez
	- first leader of the Secularization issue
	- demanded equality of regular and secular
		- Regular and secular priests were not treated as equals, Friars above secular
	- saw it as an issue within catholic church
	- died in an earthquake

- jose burgos
	- suceeded pelaez
	- saw the issue instead as an issue within the colonial society
		- said that they weren't allowed because they were filipinos
	- spanish gov was threatened
	- secularization movement masterminded by him
		- a lot of filipinos supported
		- but he died because of this
		- filipinos believed that reforms would only be accepted if they directly asked help from the king...? yes

Issues would emerge in the late 19th century that would limit the influence of the secularization movement.
- Cavite Mutiny (1872) – led by General Rafael Izquierdo, masterminded by Mariano Gomez, Burgos, and Jacinto Zamora

## Ilustrados and La Propaganda

- 1872 – execution of GomBurZa
	- Convinced the middle class that reforms implemented through the colonial government is impossible, need to bring them up to the king of Spain – the middle class supported the Secularization movement
		- this secularization movement led to the rise of a politically vocal middle class
		- they were able to study abroad
		- called ilustrados
		- This sparked the beginning of La Propaganda
	- The Ilustrados would be the first to call all members of the Philippine society, regardless of background or religion, as Filipinos 

- Demands from the Propaganda Movement to the King of Spain
	- Recognition of the Philippines as a province of Spain
	- Representation of the Philippines in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish Parliament
	- Secularization of Philippine parishes
	- Legalization of Spanish and Filipino equality
	- Equal opportunity for Filipinos and Spanish to enter government service
	- Creation of a public school system independent of the Friars – the school system at the time was run by the Friars
	- Abolition of the polo and vandala
	- Guarantee of basic freedoms of speech and association
	- Recognition of the human rights of Filipinos 

- ilustrados realized...
	- spanish describe pre-colonial period as time of darkness because no light of "civilization"
	- spanish describe colonial period as a time of enlightenment
		- so filipinos must have "utang of loob" to the spanish
		- and they must pay tribute to spanish
	- so darknesss is to pre-colonial as light is to colonial
	- their concept of light is attached to christianity

- but ilustrados see it as...
	- pre-colonial was period of enlightenment when early Filipinos trade with neighbors in East and Southeast Asia
	- colonial period as an agreement between spaniards and filipinos
		- latter will give up freedom in exchange of the former's protection
		- spaniards failed to uphold their side of the contract, so colonial period is darkness...
	- post-colonial period
		- period when Philippines is no longer a colony of Spain
		- freedom of the Philippines
		- if agreement, then philippines becomes a province of spain. if not, then philippines becomes an independent nation
	- their concept of light is attached to civilization and progress
	- we call this view as the *tripartite* point of view
		- but they have different views still
			- marcelo h del pilar
				- biggest problem was the friars
				- pre-colonial
					- no enlightenment
					- need mother spain to civilize filipinos
				- colonial
					- encomenderos first charged with civilizing mission
					- civilization process attached to friars hidered progress
				- post-colonial
					- friars must go
					- revolution is good but liberal reform is better (integration of Philippines with Spain)
			- graciano lopez jaena
				- friars still problem, but filipinos have the capacity to keep progressing
				- pre-colonial
					- primitive state, but had a civilization and a degree of enlightenment
				- colonial
					- capacity for progress impeded by friars
					- progress only because of Filipinos
			- jose rizal
				- filipinos already had a civilization... spanish just impeding it
				- different from prev two because doesn't put all blame on friars, but puts blame on colonial system
				- pre-colonial
					- filipinos already had a civilization
					- maybe even more advanced than spanish
				- colonial
					- corruption and decay
					- priests were actually friendly (protecting the filipinos), but got corrupted because of colonialism
					- filipinos are hardworking, but system made them insolent
				- post-colonialism
					- counter is nationalism
					- tactically, should reform first
					- but if not, should be revolution

Because of differing views, the movement would split into the Pilaristas and Rizalistas.

### La Liga Filipina

With the failure to establish a leader, Rizal would then go on and return to the Philippines to establish La Liga Filipinas.

- Established by Rizal
- Rizal would then be arrested, splitting the Liga into multiple factions.
	- moderate
		- believed that Liga is a grp meant to support the propaganda movement in spain
		- led by apolinario mabini
	- radical fraction
		- led by andres bonifacio and deodato arellano
		- believed the Liga was a stepping stone towards a revolutionary movement
		- decided to establish a revolutionary group (KKK or Katipunan)
			- head of katipunan is the supremo (first was deodato arellano, then roman basa, then andres bonifacio) (first two didn't recruit enough)

---
### Katipunan

The Katipunan would then decide to revolt against the Spaniards.

- Usually thought of as a plebian movement, but the leaders of the katipunan are actually primarily middle class
- Would lose most of its early battles, succeeding in Cavite
- However, Katipuneros in Cavite were split into the Magdiwang (led by Alvarez of Silang) and Magdalo (led by Aguinaldos and Tirolas of Kawit)
- NOT in the Katipunan as a whole, factions limited to Cavite “branch”
- Bonifacio would decide to mediate in the factions
- Both Bonifacio and Aguinaldo were members of the middle class, though what separates them is where they are from
	- andres bonifacio - urban middle class
		- most are ilustrados or semi-ilustrados
	- rural elites - principales
		- strong influence in rural areas
		- economic power tied to political power
	- urban middle class vs rural middle class
		- bonifacio vs aguinaldo
			- as president
			- voted for kababayan aguinaldo
			- aguinaldo was leader of state cavite, and cavite was successful for the revolution?
			- bonifacio was nominated for every position and lost all of them except for secretary, but someone said that a lawyer was best fit for that position too
			- aguinaldo ordered to capture bonifacio because he was a counter revolutionary, which led to his execution
			- we celebrate bonifacio day on his birthday and not his death day because it is the filipinos who killed bonifacio

- Tejeros Convention (1897) – meant to resolve the conflict bet. Magdiwang and Magdalo; became a conflict bet. the Urban and Rural middle classes from the rivalry of Bonifacio and Aguinaldo
	- Decided to elect a government, with Bonifacio and Aguinaldo leading in elections 
	- Aguinaldo won as President – they believed the Katipunan should be led by Cavitenos
	- Bonifacio was nominated in every position, but lost in all but won for secretary of interior but was challenged by Daniel Tirola who argued the position should go to a lawyer
		- After Bonifacio pointed a gun at him, the meeting became null and void

- Bonifacio would then go to establish a new government supported by Katipuneros 
	- Aguinaldo, with power consolidated in Cavite, ordered the arrest of Bonifacio, accusing him as counter-revolutionary
	- Bonifacio would be captured, tried in military court and executed in May 1897 in Mt. Buntis
		- We do not celebrate Bonifacio Day in May as it was the Filipinos who killed Bonifacio

---

Aguinaldo would then be leader of the PH revolution.
