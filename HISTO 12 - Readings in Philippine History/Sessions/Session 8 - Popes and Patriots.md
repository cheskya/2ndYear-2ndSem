After the collapse of the first Philippine Republic, resistance was still alive well after Aguinaldos’ Arrest

---

## Remnants of the first Philippine Republic

- Miguel Malvar – Aguinaldo’s “successor”
	- By virtue on the law of succession of the First Philippine Republic, the highest ranking officer of the armed forces will be President if the president and vice president cannot assume duty 
	- Malvar continued to fight the Americans for at least 1 year, even after Aguinaldo’s arrest in 1901
		- Served as commander-in-chief from 7/31/1901-4/16/1902
		- Americans would use scorched earth tactics against Malvar’s forces, forcing him to surrender after one year of struggle
			- Scorched earth – destroying everything you have so as not to surrender resources to your enemy – results in the suffering of the population 
	- So several historians consider Malvar as the second president of the First Philippine Republic

- Artemio “The Viper” Ricarte 
	- Most generals and military leaders surrender to the Americans after the capture of Aguinaldo and Malvar’s surrender
	- Two key personnel refused to take an oath of allegiance to the United States, namely Ricarte (chief-of-staff of the revolutionary army) and Mabini (former prime minister of Aguinaldo)
	- Both were sent to Guam; Mabini would eventually take the oath of allegiance before dying to cholera in 1903
	- Ricarte refused to take the oath, so he was exiled to Hong Kong but would escape to the Philippines
	- Was arrested in Bataan for trying to re-ignite the revolution and imprisoned in Bilibid; would be sent again to Hong Kong after refusing to take the oath
	- Would escape to Yokohama, Japan where he lived for 27 years for protection 
		- Taught Spanish in different schools in Japan
		- His wife, Agueda opened a small Filipino restaurant called Karihan Luvimin
	- Ricarte would return to the Philippines during WWII – became an ally of the Japanese Armed Forces, still hoping to free the Philippines from the United States 
	- Would then die in WWII

## Supporters of the Bonifacio-faction of the Katipunan

- Macario Sakay
	- After Aguinaldo’s capture, several Katipuneros who supported Bonifacio after the Tejeros convention refused to surrender to the Americans
	- Under the leadership of Sakay, these forces would retreat to the mountains of Morong (modern day Rizal) and declare the establishment of the Republika ng Katagalugan in 1902
	- Became the president of the Tagalog republic and organized an army to fight the Americans
	- US – would refer to Sakay and his men as tulisanes (thieves) and bandoleros (bandits) to delegitimize tier image as patriots fighting for independence
	- Members of the Republic were best known for their long hair – refusal to cut their hair short because Americans would attack them when they do
	- Would surrender on 7/14/1906 – Sakay and his men were welcomed by banquets organized by the people of Morong
	- Sakay would be arrested in 7/17/1906, refusing to give amnesty to the revolutionaries
		- Sakay would then be accused of a bandit and hanged on September 13, 1907
	- Sakay’s image would only change after his death – positive historical revisionism
	- Considered by historians as the official successor of Malvar for the presidency

- Dominador Gomez
	- Labor union leader 
	- Convinced Sakay to surrender in exchange of a general amnesty

## Millenarian Movements

Series of movements whose belief systems and societal engagement are structured around the world, the time for the final judgment, and/or the second coming of Christ 

- Millennial – from millennium, the belief that the world would end after 1000 years 
- Not exclusive to Christianity – there are Millenarian Muslims, for example 
- Social structures would change at the time, so there was an emergence of quasi-religious groups who would claim to have connections with the supernatural
- Mixed religious beliefs with national imaginings 

These movements would be more political later on.

- Confradia de San Jose (Colorum)
	- first “political millenarian movement”
	- Dedicated to Saint Joseph (San Jose)
	- Centered around Tayabas province (modern day Quezon), revolted against Spain from 1840-1841
	- Leader – Apolinario dela Cruz (Hermano Pule)
		- Declared the “King of the Tagalogs” during the revolt 
		- Captured, killed, dismembered body was displayed by the Americans around Manila and its suburbs 
	- Practiced Folk Catholicism – example of syncretism 
		- Merging folk religion with Catholic doctrine
		- Form of revolt against the Catholic church who would refuse to recognize them 
	- The revolt would be crushed, but then revived in 1870 by Juanario Labios, who declared himself as a Pope and Prophet
	- Ends all their ceremonies with the phrase “saecula saecolorum” (a new world for the new age) 
		- Hence, the confradia would become more commonly known as the Colorum 
		- The phrase might not actually be in Latin but a made up form
	- Would join the Philippine revolution but would be massacred by the Spaniards
		- Would bring ropes because of a voice heard by Labios
		- Labios would then claim they “did not pray hard enough”

- Guardia de Honor
	- Religious confraternity that started as a group of peasants tasked by the Dominican Friars to guard Our Lady of Manaoag
		- Originally known as the Guardia de Honor de Maria
	- Would side the the Dominicans in the revolution, so they were against the Revolution
		- Became militant, functioning as the primary protector of the friars in the province of Pangasinan and Tarlac
	- Established their base in Barrio Cabaruan in Pangasinan
	- Led by Juan “Apo Lakay” Baltazar, who claimed to be God Almighty 
		- Apo – title of authority
		- Right-hand man – Antonio Valdez (Jesus Christ)
		- Also under him were Gregorio Claviera (Holy Ghost), Maria dela Cruz (Virgin Mary)
		- Protected by 12 lieutenants who were collectively referred to as the “apostles”
	- Would become more militant during the Revolution
	- After the end of Spanish rule, the militarized Guardia began raiding haciendas – both the Malolos Republic and American Armed Forces tried to suppress the group 
	- The Americans would then crush the Guardia de Honor, dismember Baltazar, and Massacre the people of Cabaruan 
		- Would welcome them with fiestas but raid nearby haciendas
	- The remaining members of the Guardia de Honor spread throughout Pangasinan, La Union, and Central Luzon in the aftermath of American suppression

- Santa Iglesia
	- Established by Felipe “Apo Ipe” Salvador, a colonel in the Revolutionary Army in Pampanga in the latter part of 1900
	- Centered around Mt. Arayat, where Salvador would assume the title of Pope and chief pontiff 
		- Salvador claimed that the sinners that supposed the Americans will drown in a great flood that will cleanse the world from evil 
	- Formed an army that would fight American forces until 1906
	- Salvador claimed to have received orders from Rizal, Bonifacio, the Gomburza, and the Santong Boses to fight the Americans 
		- Belief that you can see them in Mount Arayat and Banahaw and they can give you amulets 
		- Would be captured in 1902 but escape until 1910 
			- Executed by the Americans on 4/5/1912
	- Apo Ipe would go on to be a quasi-mythical figure in Tarlac and Pampanga with some claiming to have seen his spirit at the peak of Mt. Arayat well into the 1970s 

### Continuing Influence of Millenarian Movements

Colorum rebelled in the 1920s and 1930s – many members of these movements joined the Sakdal Party in the 1930s

## How Americans Responded

- Legal Suppression 
	- Brigandage Act of 1902 – being a bandit is punishable by death, was used to label people as bandits 
	- Anti-Sedition Law of 1907
	- Flag Act of 1907 (Act No. 1696) 
- Military Suppression
	- Establishment of the Philippine Constabulary (Military Police) 
	- Psychological warfare – public executions, coverage of arresting subversives, use of scorched-earth tactics

## Folk Catholicism

Can be used as a representation of the consciousness of the masses 

- Can glean from them the ideals of the masses and their perspectives through the Pasyon – redeeming Paradise through revolution 
- However, it can be argued that framing Folk Catholicism this way is that i is culturally normal for Filipinos to follow Authoritarian leaders
- The other side of the debate – merely the language used to explain their material reality
