## Filipino Response to Japanese Occupation

### Collaboration

War as a means to escape debts!

#### From Above

*The Japanese knew the immense influence that the elites have in Filipino society. They decided to collaborate with former members of the Quezon administration.*

Kalibapi was the only political party allowed to operate at the time. The PH was a one-party state.

- Logo of Kalibapi
	- Bayanihan – pre-colonial Philippines as free of Western influence
	- Ultra-nationalism, embrace of fascist ideals such as the establishment of a one-party state 
	- Palm Tree – exoticization, need to “civilize in an Asian manner” 
	- Emphasize the Philippines’ “Oriental Identity”
	- Sun – found in the flag of the Malolos Republic; Occupation as a continuation of Filipino resistance to American colonialism

- Members of Kalibapi
	- Jorge Vargas
		- Secretary of National Defense under the Quezon administration
		- Chairperson of the Philippine Executive Commission 
			- PEC – provisional gov’t. established by Japan to ease the transition from the Commonwealth to a Japanese-sponsored Government
		- Philippine ambassador to Japanese – one of the most important positions w/in the government during the Occupation
		- When Quezon left Manila, (1942-1943) Vargas functioned as leader of the Philippine government.
	- Benigno Aquino, Sr.
		- Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce under the Quezon administration 
		- Appointed as director-general of the KALIBAPI 
			- Kapinsanan sa Paglilingkod ng Bagong Pilipinas (KALIBAPI) is the only political party allowed to operate during the Japanese Occupation. The Philippines is a one party state during the Occupation.
		- Functioned as the Speaker of the House of the National Assembly
			- Unicameral Legislature of the 2nd Republic 
	- Jose P. Laurel 
		- Former associate Justice of the Supreme Court
		- Secretary of justice under the Quezon administrations 
		- President of the Preparatory for Philippine Independence
			- Committee established by the Japanese to recommend provisions for drafting a new constitution to replace the 1935 one
			- Chosen to be the first President of the Second Philippine Republic
			- “Second” – meant to be a successor to Malolos 

Jose Vargas, Benigno Aquino Sr., and Jose Laurel were members of the Quezon cabinet.

Other collaborators were...

- Jose Yulo
- Manuel Roxas
- Elpidio Quirino
- Ramon Avacena 
- Claro M. Recto
- Quintin Paredes 
- Camilo Osias

A deeper analysis...

Japanese Occupation is usually depicted as halting the march of the Philippines towards Independence. However, most leaders during the occupation period are the same as those in the Commonwealth period...

- One of the Japanese policies implemented was continuity – continuing of terms of leaders in the Commonwealth era 
- So the Occupation was more of a continuation of the Commonwealth era – most of the concerns that arose during the two are the same 
	- Language, Womens’ Rights, etc. 
- So the collaboration from above tried to protect the rights and privileges that existed w/in the Commonwealth era, but framing them in the Japanese framework 
	- Also trying to protect their own privileges under that framework – most of them are pro-elites 
- Collaboration rather than crackdown 

#### From Below

*Those who hoped to break the elite domination of Philippine politics hoped that the Japanese Occupation will open new political spaces for the masses.*

Important people and groups:

- Artemio Ricarte
	- Ricarte agreed to help in Japan’s propaganda efforts
	- Became a key member of the Propaganda Corps – faction of the Japanese preferred a Filipino government under Ricarte dictatorship 

- Benigno Ramos
	- Ramos’ Ganap Party was banned by the Japanese military
	- Ganaptistas, however, were prioritized in the hiring of additional labor needed by the Japanese military and receiving of rations 
	- Also became Commander-in-Chief of the Makapili 

- Makapili
	- was a volunteer armed group
	- functions as a reserved force during the war.
	- Most recruits are former Ganaptistas – peasants disappointed 
	- Not under the Kalibapi or the 2nd republic 

### Resistance

Filipino everyday resistance to the Japanese took many forms. Some provided intel and resources to guerilla fighters. Other’s used cockfighting arenas, theaters, sports venues as a meeting place for espionage. Other forms of resistance are more mundane. Comic actors tell jokes mocking the Japanese while workers often circumvent curfew.

Let's talk about guerillas!

- USAFFE
	- Remnants of USAFFE that refused to surrender to the Japanese. In photo, Ramon Magsaysay, guerilla unit commander in Zambales.
- HukBaLaHap
	- Peasant unions of Central Luzon organized guerilla units called Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon. In photo, Nieves Fernandez teaching a soldier how she cut the head of Japanese soldiers.
- Filipino-Chinese
	- Filipino-Chinese and exiled Chinese organized different guerilla groups. In photo, Wha-Chi, the largest Chinese guerilla group in the Philippines. 
- Moro
	- Moros also resisted the Japanese through guerilla warfare. In photo: Soldiers of the Sultanate of Sulu during World War II 

Guerillas have different goals during the Japanese Occupation.

- USAFFE Guerillas wanted to prepare the Philippines for the eventual return of the Americans.
- HukBaLaHap Guerillas attempted to defeat the Japanese before the Americans return to the archipelago.
- Although different guerillas groups often collaborate with each other, the difference in goals created tensions between these groups.

### Survival

- 1943 Constitution – meant to align with the Japanese narrative 
- In 10/14/1942, the PH would become "independent"
	- Own government but controlled by the Japanese 
	- So the 2nd Republic was established 
		- Flag is the same as that of the First 
		- Had a new national anthem
		- Lyrics – call to action, strong promotion of Nationalism
		- War as a part of creating the New Philippines 
		- Emphasizing sacrifices – recognizing Philippine hardship 

- Constabulary – bad reputation in the Philippines, seen as a repressive institution (also acts as security for the Japanese) 
- Kempeitai – the secret police of the Japanese 
- Contradiction – the Japanese do not know how to speak Filipino, and vice versa
- Certain pieces of propaganda would also quote historical figures like Rizal
- Japan as an industrial country (and thus more powerful), the Philippines as an inherently agricultural country
	- Reflected in numerous propaganda made at the time
