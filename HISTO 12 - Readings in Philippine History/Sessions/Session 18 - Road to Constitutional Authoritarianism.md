### Marcos and Imelda

Marcos Myth:

- the state as a family
- Ferdinand as Malakas
- Imelda as Maganda

Used cinema as presidential campaign...

- "Make the Philippines great again!" But when was the Philippines ever great? This was something Marcos had to answer.

- "Iginuhit ng Tadhanda: The Ferdinand E. Marcos Story" (1965)
	- A political propaganda film. ([see here](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371738/))
	- Marcos as destined to lead the nation to greatness.
	- Marcos presented himself as the man ("Man of Destiny") who could help the PH embrace her own culture and tradition (from colonialism into own identity.)
	- Imelda as the "Woman of Ambition"
		- The sexual revolution would create the rise of the Bomba Star
		- Ambitious like a bomba, but someone that complements the destiny of Marcos.

- "Pinagbuklod ng Langit"
	- The sequel to the previous film mentioned.
	- Shows the daily lives of the Marcos family in the Malacanang.

- The dictatorship is not just Marcos, but also Imelda.
	- Ferdinand and Imelda as daddy and mommy ng bayan.
	- Obsession with the narrative of the "New" Bagong Pilipinas...
	- Why was this appealing?
		- Image similar to Clientelism ‚Äì reciprocity, parental figures; nostalgia that came with the decline of patron-client relationships in the countrysides¬†
	    - By presenting themselves as father and mother of the nation, they present themselves as bringing back a sense of reciprocity in the nation ‚Äì this is what the Marcoses meant by ‚ÄúMaking the Nation Great Again‚Äù: *nostalgia*

## National Sexuality

(copy pasted from PPT)

‚ÄúMarcos‚Äôs campaign to clean up the cinema asserts a ‚Äúnational heterosexuality,‚Äù which Berlant and Warner describe as ‚Äúthe mechanism by which a core national culture can be imagined as a sanitized space of sentimental feeling and immaculate behavior, a space for pure citizenship.‚Äù
