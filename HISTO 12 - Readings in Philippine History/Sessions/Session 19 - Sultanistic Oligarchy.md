## Oligarchs and Oligarchy

Resources:
- [Definition of "oligarchy" (from Britannica)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/oligarchy)
- Winters, J. A. (2012). Oligarchy. Cambridge Univ. Press.

### Two Kinds of Oligarchs (the people/groups)

- Wild
	- Oligarchs are uncontrolled.
	- They regulate institutions that is supposed to regulate them.

- Tamed
	- Oligarchs are controlled by specific institutions (State, Church, etc.)

### Four Types of Oligarchy (the concept)

- Warring Oligarchy
	- Oligarchs are directly engaged in providing coercion that defends their wealth. Often fragmented and individualistic (Political Warlords).
	- Example: Feudal Japan, Early 20th Century China, Feudal Europe, Post-colonial Failed States

- Ruled Oligarchy
	- Higher degree of cooperation between oligarchs. Collective rule is institutionalized in a governing body exclusively composed of oligarchs.
	- Example: Italian Mafia and American Mafia, Early Athens, Roman Republic, 9th-12th Century Catholic Church.

- Sultanistic Oligarchy
	- Single oligarch exercise rule in a direct and personal fashion. Other oligarchs disarm to a significant degree either through coercion or cooptation.
	- Example: Roman Empire, Nazi Germany, Napoleonic France, Soviet Union under Stalin, Post-Colonial Authoritarian States, Philippines during Martial Law (Marcos), Former Republic of Indonesia (Suharto)

- Civil Oligarchy
	- Oligarchs fully disarm, cease to rule directly, and hand over the task of wealth defense to an impersonal bureaucratic state.
	- Example: Contemporary United States, Singapore, Post-war Japan, Post-dictatorship South Korea and Taiwan

## Cultural Development

Marcos' promise was to "make the nation great again."

Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) (not sure what they have to do with this but they're in the PPT)

- Marcos would use facts 
- Convinced historians, mostly from UP, to ghostwrite history books for them
	- Marcos’ image as scholar
	- Goal was to write a history that aligns with the “Tadhana” narrative 
	- The first volume on precolonial Philippines would be published, but the series would never finish due to lack of funding

---

## Economic Development

- Japan would pass a law on giving loans to other countries because of their loans to the Marcos administration – stricter rules because Marcos mishandled funds 
- The Asian Development Bank

---

## Developmental State

- The United States supported Marcos’ programs through bilateral and multilateral loans
- Wanted to ensure stability of the Philippines to protect its bases in the archipelago and its interest in Southeast Asia
- Martial Law would be lifted in 1981 
- Manila Film Center – a rushed project that failed
	- The government would refuse to cover the incident
	- There are rumors of corpses being hidden under the cement.
- By 1986 – 92.9% of GDP was debt 
	- Other countries like the US and Switzerland have exceeded 100%, so what actually matters is where the money is spent – strong social services
		- In the Philippines, however, social services were weak 
- Industries were underdeveloped, causing widespread extreme poverty

## Opposition to the Marcos Regime

- Revolutionary Opposition
	- People joined revolutionary groups.
	- Moro Secessionists (MNLF and MILF)
	- Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army
	- Rebels in the Cordilleras

- Legal Opposition
	- Attempted to reject the Dictatorship through legal means.
	- Members of the old political elites that form small political parties such as Lakas ng Bayan (LABAN) of Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino and United Nationalist Democratic Organization (UNIDO) of Salvador “Doy” Laurel

- Religious Opposition
	- The Church had a "marriage of convenience" with the Regime (would stay silent)
	- Christians for National Liberation (CNL) and Radical Priests and Pastors
	- Roman Catholic Church after the appointment of Jaime Cardinal Sin as archbishop of Manila

- Military budget would increase, but rebel groups were not completely wiped out.
	- This is what led to the collapse of the regime
