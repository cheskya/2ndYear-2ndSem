## Historiography
- the study of the process of writing, analysis, and interpretation of history
- (based on interpretation, so it can change)

## History
- recreation of past events usually arranged in chronological order
	- however, you cannot recreate everything in the past. but the past happens.
	- therefore, the method of our interpretation of the past is what changes, and what changes our understanding (see [[#Historiography]])
	- history itself (with its facts and all) does not actually change
- independent of human mind
	- however, what we remember is what we see in history
	- therefore, history is in a way CREATED but INDEPENDENT of us humans
	- the manner of how we interpret it is always subject to human subjectivity though
- not purely subjective nor objective
	- objective because it is a record of the past using historical facts
	- subjective because it is a narrative of the past
- creates the memory necessary to construct the community that is being imagined
	- see [[#Nation]]
	- history -> institutional memory -> official nationalism

## Kasaysayan
- isang salaysay na may saysay sa mga taong sinasaysayan nito
- history depends on the people it is referring to
	- e.g. "magellan discovered the philippines" belongs to the history of spain, not the philippines. we were here before you!

## The Objective Part of History
### Primary Sources
- first hand accounts
### Secondary Sources
- interpretations or commentaries of the primary sources
- use this when there are no primary sources, or to expand the narrative (fill the gaps, etc.)
- you can also use this to locate primary sources (they all link together)
	- basically a repository of primary sources


## The Subjective Part of History
### Historical Imagination
- the insertion of a historian's subjectivity to the historical narrative
- used to fill in the gaps... to assume...
- must always adhere to established historical facts

---

## Historical Criticism
### External Criticism
- check the *authenticity* of the source
	- does the source come from the timeframe it alludes to?
### Internal Criticism
- check the *reliability* of the source
	- what are the potential biases embedded in the source?

---

## Analysis of Sources
### Content
- *what* are the narratives, ideas, concepts etc. embedded within a specific source?
### Context
- *how* do the narratives, concepts, and ideas relate to the historical period?

## Nation
- by Benedict Anderson
- a nation is an imagined political community that is both limited and sovereign
	- imagined because members don't all know each other
	- limited because no nation encompasses all mankind
	- sovereign because nations came into being during enlightenment and for freedom
	- community because a nation is conceived of as a horizontal comradeship of equals
