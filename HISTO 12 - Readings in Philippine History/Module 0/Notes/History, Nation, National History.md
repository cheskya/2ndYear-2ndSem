## Definition of "History"
- "A continuous process of interaction between the historian and his facts, an unending dialogue between the present and the past." -- Edward Carr
	- historians choose what facts to leave out
	- historians choose how to interpret facts (e.g. white man's bias?) (facts are affected by historian's context)
- "Relationship between the past and the historian's thoughts about it." -- Collingwood
- just "pure" facts?! (by nineteenth century historians) (not true, because there is still bias in the way historians choose and interpret facts)

(from sir's module 0.1)
- The process of writing history is called historiography.
- Historians are those who apply the historiographic method in analyzing a society. They present and scrutinize historical facts to recreate and interpret past events.
- Each historian is unique and has their approach to history. But all historians follow the golden rule of the historiographic method: **history should be based on facts supported by historical data**.
- Historical data is taken from the analysis of historical sources.

This is from the lecture! January 18, 2024 on Thursday for HISTO 12.
## Historiography
- the study of the process of writing, analysis, and interpretation of history
- (based on interpretation, so it can change)

## History
- recreation of past events usually arranged in chronological order
	- however, you cannot recreate everything in the past. but the past happens.
	- therefore, the method of our interpretation of the past is what changes, and what changes our understanding (see [[#Historiography]])
	- history itself (with its facts and all) does not actually change
- independent of human mind
	- however, what we remember is what we see in history
	- therefore, history is in a way CREATED but INDEPENDENT of us humans
	- the manner of how we interpret it is always subject to human subjectivity though
- not purely subjective nor objective
	- objective because it is a record of the past using historical facts
	- subjective because it is a narrative of the past

## Kasaysayan
- isang salaysay na may saysay sa mga taong sinasaysayan nito
- history depends on the people it is referring to
	- e.g. "magellan discovered the philippines" belongs to the history of spain, not the philippines. we were here before you!

## The Objective Part of History
### Primary Sources
- first hand accounts
### Secondary Sources
- interpretations or commentaries of the primary sources
- use this when there are no primary sources, or to expand the narrative (fill the gaps, etc.)
- you can also use this to locate primary sources (they all link together)
	- basically a repository of primary sources


## The Subjective Part of History
### Historical Imagination
- the insertion of a historian's subjectivity to the historical narrative
- used to fill in the gaps... to assume...
- must always adhere to established historical facts
