# Session 10 idk

Breakdown of their characters:
- Quezon - aggressive and charismatic (go go go!)
- Osmena - mild-mannered (will leave a situation if he knows he can't handle it)

---

## Independence Missions
- there have been multiple led by Manuel Quezon, Manuel Roxas, and Sergio Osmena Sr.
- 1932 and 1934 were successful
	- influenced by the Great Depression and the militarization of Japan
- early independence missions partly inspired by the enactment of the Jones Law in 1916 and the Filipino experience under the Gov-Genship of Leonard Wood
	- Wood was against the Filipinization of the government
	- says that the Filipinos have corrupted American democracy because the projects of the Filipinos are not meant to help Americans, just "vanity" projects to increase the pride of the Filipino
	- for him he wants to delay because the Filipinos need to learn American democracy first
	- he vetoed most of the bills passed, which put him in collision course with Quezon and Osmena
	- missions failed because of American's insistence on keeping the PH and the rivalry between Quezon and Osmena

---

## Os-Rox Mission
- take advantage of the socio-econommic situation in the US
- succeeded in securing the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act of 1933
- ...but it failed to pass the PH senate
	- because while Os-Rox was in the US, Quezon realized that their bill would be passed and he'd be sidelined. so Quezon negotiated within the the party, ousting most of Osmena's followers
	- although he tried to show he was STILL pro-independence despite the fact that he was against the bill by looking for flaws in the act and noted that this bill would not bring true independence
- openly challenged Osmena (either he resigns or Quezon resigns)
- after he won by votes, he then challenged Osmena to create his own party

## Quezon Mission
- secure a more favorable independence bill for the PH
- suceeded in securing the Tydings-Mcduffie Act of 1934
	- similar to HHC except...
	- for security, unclear if American bases will remain
	- for immigration, there is a cap of 50 immigrants per year (as opposed to HHC which has no cap)
