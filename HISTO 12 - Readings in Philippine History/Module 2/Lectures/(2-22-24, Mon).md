In the case of the first query 12 starting with YY:
- keep going until you reach a N? or YN
	- if YN, use that to deduce information about the previous and next person, as well as backtrack if there are other previous people who said YY
	- if N?, use that to deduce information about the previous person, as well as backtrack if there are other previous people who said YY
- continue
	- keep doing the 56, 67, 78 etc query chain

## Huk Rebellion
Why was there an increase in capitalism among the landowners in the 1930's?
- Great Depression in America
- America exporting more cash crops from the Philippines
	- this put pressure on competitors in the US
	- which is why they WANTED to raise import taxes and tariffs, put quota, BUT they couldn't do this without political things involved, so...
	- they gave the Philippines its independence, which means you could limit their exports and put tariffs
- scarcity of land, can no longer expand

Can use state apparatus to make use of demands. (Landowners have the right to use Philippine Constabulary to suppress farmers because of their contracts.)

## Sakdalista Party

- Ramos is a former protege of Manuel Quezon
	- had a falling out because Quezon refused to support student protestors against an American Teacher
- the newspaper tackles...
	- 

True independence
- return to the ideals of Katipunan
- US should not interfere in the internal and external sovereignty of the PH
- should be immediate
Immediate Independence
- the US must give the PH its independence immediately without any compromises and transition period

For the peasantry, the recognition of their human dignity in the eyes of the landowners (care, equality, respect) was good.

Not just demanding that their landowners have the same relationship with them again, but also that their human dignity is recognized (justice, equality, dignity.)


Lapian ng Bayan Api, Sangkapuluan Filipinas (L. x B. A.-S. F.)
Bayang Api (communist):
- proletariat
Bayang Api (sakdalista):
- everyone who felt oppressed

Rumors were spreading about Ramos returning to the PH with weapons and Japanese support. So, the sakdal party had an uprising against the commonwealth gov and were brutally suppressed. Ramos, upon returning to the PH, was arrested. The sakdalista party was disbanded.

Some party members went to a new party called Ganap.
- called Ganaptistas
- they were Pro-Japanese
- some went on to also create a new group called "Makapili" that also supported Japan
