## Peasant Unrest
Majorities of farmers are peasant farmers.
### Buwisan System
- hacienderos lease lands to peasants
- peasants will pay rent in full, rent functions like monthly taxation
### Kasama System
- hacienderos lease land to iquilinos who will also lease land to the peasants
- peasants will pay thru a combo of montly rent and crop sharing with inquilinos and hacenderos
- term *kasama* refers to peasants who share their crops to their landlords

Hacendero (landlord) <- Inquilino <- Kasama

Tenant-farmers (kasama) will pay rent and shoulder all expenses in managing the land. All crops will be shared between farmers and their landlord.

The system is not fair, but why do people still participate in it?
- In exchange of protection, there is loyalty.

Patron
- has the responsibility to provide for his tenants
Client
- must remain loyal to his patron
