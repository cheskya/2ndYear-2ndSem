political party
- grouping of people with same political idealogy
- larger than a party list
party list
- specific feature in our 1987 constitution
- giving representation to marginalized sectors in the congress
	- a lot of political plans before the 1987 constitution, so it was hard to here the voices of the marginalized

*Note:* A census is a way to track the population (ages, genders, origins, etc)

## Second Philippine Commission
- Taft Commission
	- led by William Howard Taft
	- americanistas
		- philippines politics were dominated by this
		- political goal - they wanted the PH to be a state of the US
		- dominant figures within the group
			- trinidad
			- paterno (this guy keeps shifting sides buh)
			- araneta
			- buencamino
		- some of them were formerly supporters of the revolutionary government. but why did they start supporting this position?
			- to protect economic interests (more practical than waging war)
			- all they wanted was positions in the government (see propagandists goals of becoming a state of spain), not so much about complete impendence
		- formed the political party called "Partido Federal"
			- main platform is statehood (to become a part of the US)
			- changed their name to "partido progresista"
				- platform no longer just being a part of the US, but in general progress for the filipinos
				- i forgot why they changed their name exactly, like what in their environment prompted them to change their name
			- other parties
				- partido nacionalista
					- main platform is nationhood (to become completely and immediately independent from US)
					- once elections were held, they gained more votes
						- in reality, more filipinos actually wanted independence
						- additionally, they had a lot of networks in local communities compared to partido progresista, so they naturally gained more votes (networks are important in philippine politics, even today)
				- *note:* you need to be close to taft (partonage) to actually have positions in the government
				- *note:* it was important to get positions at first because all of them were appointed (no census, therefore no election yet, therefore no philippine assembly yet, only the philippine commission)

Jones Law of 1916
- US was still very vague about when to let PH be independent
	- "when it's independent enough for us" what does that mean??
- insular gov
	- divisions (new changes)
		- executive
			- governor-general - william howard taft
			- vice governor
			- cabinet
			- internal auditor
		- legislative (bicameral, and both are now elected. both leaders were also from the nacionalista part, and encountered rivalry)
			- ph senate
				- senate president
					- first one was Manuel L. Quezon
			- house or representatives
				- speaker of the house
					- first one of Sergio Osmena Sr.
		- judiciary
			- supreme court
			- courts of first instance
- nacionalista
	- would dominate politics
	- however, no clear ideology beyond independence
	- therefore, filipinos started voting based on personalities (you don't know what will happen anyway, so better to vote for the person you can approach)
		- both legislative houses came from the nacionalista party and experienced rivalry
		- division
			- quezon wing (colectvistas)
			- osmena wing (unipersonalistas)
- progresista
	- would collapse and become the "partido democrata"
	- started to push for independence as well
		- no clear division, no clear goals as well
