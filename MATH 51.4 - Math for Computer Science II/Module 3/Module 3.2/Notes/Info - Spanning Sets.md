## Definition of Spanning Set

![[definition-spanning-set.png]]

Basically, in order to determine if a set of vectors $S$ spans $\mathbb{R}^n$, we need to solve a linear system.

When a set of vector $S$ spans $\mathbb{R}^n$, it means that they can form a valid coordinate system for $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Properties of Spanning Set

1. A coordinate system in $\mathbb{R}^n$ must be able to express every vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$. (Can write every vector as a linear combination of the spanning set.)

1. Different coordinates in a coordinate system should refer to different vectors. (Can write every vector as a UNIQUE linear combination of the spanning set.)
