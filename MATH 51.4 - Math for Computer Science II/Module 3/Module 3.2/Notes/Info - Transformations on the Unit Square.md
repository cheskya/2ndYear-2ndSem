## Transformations using Linear Combinations and Standard Basis Vectors

In summary, any vector $w$ is a linear combination of standard basis vectors.

A linear transformation transforms the standard basis vectors, which in turn changes the grid on which other vectors are based on

Since a linear transformation is defined purely by how it transforms the basis vectors, we can view the linear transformation $T$ instead by focusing on how it transforms the unit square in the first quadrant.
