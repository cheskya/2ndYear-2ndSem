# Algebraic Properties of Vectors

Resources:
- Canvas Modules
- [[Info - Operations on Vectors]]

*Note:* Since vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfy the algebraic and closure properties below, we can call $\mathbb{R}^n$ a special type of object called a **vector space**.

## General Properties

![[algebraic-properties-vectors.png]]

All of these properties follow from the more general properties of matrix addition and scalar multiplication!

## Closure Properties

- closure of vector addition
	- If $u,v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then $u+v\in\mathbb{R}^n$
- closure of scalar multiplication
	- If $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$ and $k\in\mathbb{R}$, then $kv\in\mathbb{R}^n$
