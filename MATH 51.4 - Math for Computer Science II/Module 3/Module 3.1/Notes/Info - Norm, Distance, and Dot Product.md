## Norm of a Vector

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can obtain formulas for the length of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

### Properties of the Norm of a Vector

*Note:* The process of multiplying a nonzero vector by the reciprocal of its length to obtain a unit vector is called *normalizing* $v$. See below!

### Applications

- By definition, the dot product is a form of weighted sum. (The value $u \cdot v$ is a sum of the components of $u$, weighted by the components of $v$, and vice versa.)

- Geometrically, a dot product encodes the angle between two vectors.

- In terms of matrices, a dot product is a left matrix multiplication by a transpose.

- In matrix multiplication, the product of two matrices $A$ and $B$ is a matrix of dot products.
