## Vector Representations

Vectors can be represented in various forms.
The real numbers in these forms are called the components or coordinates of the vectors.

Below are some example representations of vectors on a 2-dimensional plane.

## Ordered n-tuples

A vector can be defined as an ordered $n$-tuple of real numbers.

An **ordered $n$-tuple** is a sequence of $n$ real numbers $(v_1,v_2,...,v_n)$ which we treat as a $n \times 1$ vector.

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
v_1 \\
v_2 \\
\vdots \\
v_n
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The set of all ordered $n$-tuples is called a **real $n$-space** and is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^n$
