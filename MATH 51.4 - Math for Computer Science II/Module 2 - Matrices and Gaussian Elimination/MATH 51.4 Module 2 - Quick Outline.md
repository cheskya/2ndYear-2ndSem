## Module 2.1 - Solving Linear Systems
### Matrices
- for a m x n matrix...
	- there are m rows
	- there are n columns

### Linear Systems

### Linear Systems as Matrices
Make use of augmented matrices and elementary row operations.
- coefficient matrix - every coefficient of the equation counts as one entry in the matrix (one equation, one row)
- augmented matrix - same as above except you include the right side of the equation as another entry

choices for elementary row operations:
- interchange two rows
- multiply a row through by a nonzero constant
- add a constant times one row to another

tips and tricks:
- you want to get an identity matrix. so, in one row, try to get as many zeroes as you can
- to preserve the zeroes and let the remaining entry become 1, you can try dividing the entire row by the necessary fraction OR
